I am amazed by how well this first iteration turned out.

### Ingredients

For **each pound** of potatoes,

* 3 cups vegetable broth
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup cream
* 1 1/2 tbsp salt
* 1 1/2 tbsp pepper
* 1 tbsp garlic (yep)
* 1/2 tsp italian seasoning

### Prep

Dice peeled potatoes. Pressure cook them with salt, cream, butter, and broth for about 10 minutes. Use a blender ([this is mine](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-924305/calphalon-immersion-hand-blender.jsp)) to purÃ©e the mix while adding all other stuff. Add more broth to adjust until you have a consistency you like. Stuff face, then refrigerate for another day ðŸ’–

### Future Work

* Try [Yukon Gold Potatoes](https://www.myrecipes.com/extracrispy/whats-the-difference-between-russet-red-and-yukon-gold-potatoes)
* Try 1 tbsp olive oil (per pound) and dialing back the butter
