## Ingredients

* 1.5 Lbs 86% Ground Chuck Beef
* 1 Red Onion, diced
* 1/2 Yellow Onion, diced
* 1/2 Green Pepper, diced
* 1 Jalapeno, diced
* 1 TBSP Chili Powder
* 1/4 tsp Oregano
* 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
* 1/2 tsp Cumin
* 1/2 tsp Paprika
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1/8 cups Red Wine Vinegar
* 11.5 oz can V8 Juice
* 15 oz can Diced Tomatoes

## Preparation

1. Brown ground beef and red onion, season to taste.
2. Add all other ingredients to pot.
3. Cook until flavors come through.
4. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, and crackers.

## Dawn's Notes

* Don't need to use two different colors of onion.
* In place of red wine vinegar and V8, can just use flavored/spiced canned tomato sauce.
* Add as much or as little tomato sauce, diced tomatoes as you prefer. Canned crushed tomatoes also work well.
* I _highly_ suggest adding in either kidney beans and/or black beans. Beans in chili are great!
