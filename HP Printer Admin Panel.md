For my wife's printer, a _piece of shit_ HP LaserJet Pro M148fdw. PITA like all fine prosumer HP printers ✨

Found this page via macOS' "Open Printer Webpage" button.

```
http://localhost:57366/hp/device/set_config_network_Wireless.hwtml
```

**Update**: The port may change later. Here's another one:

```
http://localhost:59853/hp/device/set_config_network_Wireless.html
```

Best to go through the "Open printer webpage" button.
