Planet Bollywood is proud to present a unique 4-part series featuring 100 Greatest Soundtracks in Bollywood history. It was a monumental task to identiy such masterpieces, given that Bollywood has produced over 30,000 movie soundtracks. We selected some of the all-time-hit albums that have:

- Made an instant impact on the listeners
- After watching the movie, people liked them even more
- Have at least three songs that were superhit
- Have been etched into our memories forever


### 100 - Sholay (1975)

**Music**: R.D. Burman<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

Interestingly, Sholay songs were quite average that became popular as the days went by. The reason why Sholay songs are popular to this day, is the eternal popularity of this film. The pick of the lot was Mehbooba-Mehbooba as it became a rage, thanks to its beat and RD Burman singing. The other popular songs are ‘Yeh Dosti’, which is a perfect friendship song, and the Holi song ‘Holi Ke Din’. However, the last two songs ‘Koi Haseena Jab’ and ‘Haa Jab Tak Hai Jaan’ were barely average.

### 99 - Bees Saal Baad (1962)

**Music**: Hemant Kumar<br />
**Lyrics**: Shakeel Badayuni

Bees Saal Baad was the best selling soundtrack of 1962, and the songs still remain in the hearts of everybody today. Who can ever forget Lata Mangeshkar in the evergreen classic “Kahin Deep Jale Kahin”. This song has to be ranked as one of Lata Mangeshkar best songs ever, as she picked up the Filmfare Award for this song. Bees Saal Baad soundtrack is worth buying just for this one song, however, it has more great songs to enjoy. 'Beqarar Karke', ‘Zara Nazron Ke’ and ‘Sapne Suhane’ are superb tracks sung by Hemant Kumar who also composed music for this soundtrack. However, some may say that the let-down in this soundtrack was ‘Ae Meri Mohabbat’, but thanks to Lata Mangeshkar's perfect rendering even this song has become a memorable one. Bees Saal Baad is definitely an album worth a buy for anybody who cherishes old and classic music.

### 98 - Lucky (2005)

**Music** Director: Adnan Sami<br />
**Lyrics**: Sameer

Hands down to the best soundtrack of 2005, which was Lucky (the only entry from 2005 that made it to this list). The soundtrack released at the perfect time, around Valentine’s Day. This soundtrack seem to be the prefect Valentine's gift for your loved ones, as melody was the key factor in this soundtrack. Six songs in the soundtrack (excluding all the different mix) and five of the songs stand out hugely. From the lovable Jaan Meri Jaa Rahi Sanam, to the endearing Sun Zara, to the spectacular Shayad Yahi To Pyar Hai (easily the best song from the album), the attractive Chori Chori and the very youthful Lucky Lips, Lucky is a soundtrack that will appeal to everyone from every ages. The only disappointing song was Hum Deewane, however, those five songs easily camouflage that one song. Lucky, is simply the best album of 2005, thanks to the melody of Adnan Sami. Another factor that it had going in its favour was that it uses different singers for each track. Lata Manageshkar, Asha Bhosle, Udit Narayan, Adnan Sami, Sonu Nigam, Alka Yagnik, and Anuradha Paudwal all made a huge impact of 2005. And deservingly, Lucky was one of the best selling album of 2005, which doesn’t come up as a surprise. I wouldn’t be surprised if Adnan Sami sweeps the Best Music awards from all award function, as he truly deserves it.

### 97 - Khamoshi – The Musical (1996)

**Music**: Jatin-Lalit, Remo Fernandez<br />
**Lyrics**: Majrooh Sultanpuri, Remo Fernandez

Sanjay Leela Bhansali films always have great music, so let’s go back in time where it all began with Khamoshi – The Musical. This is was at a time where Jatin-Lalit was on a roll as they were delivering good albums one right after the other. However, Khamoshi remains a landmark for Jatin-Lalit as their songs are simply great. Out of the seven songs in the album, 6 of them were great tracks. From Aaj Main Upar (instant hit), Aankhon Main Kya (great singing from Kumar Sanu), Gaate The Pehle (great musical composition), Jana Suno Hum (excellent singing from Udit Narayan), Yeh Dil Sun Raha (Hit song), and Bahon Ke Darmiyan (easily the best song in the soundtrack), all of those six tracks are outstanding. The only letdown was Huiya Ho, which is plain below average. Except for Huiya Ho, Khamoshi is a great album, please get it. You won’t be disappointed.

### 96 - LOC-Kargil (2003)

**Music**: Anu Malik<br />
**Lyrics**: Javed Akthar

The JP Dutta-Anu Malik combo can never go wrong, as they bring superb music, and LOC-Kargil is no exception. It was sad that the soundtrack went suddenly unnoticed, due to the failure of the film at the box-office. To the soulful Seemayen Bulayen Tujhe (great singing by Alka Yagnik), to the perfect love duet ‘Pyar Bhara Geeth’(Sonu Nigam-Shreya Ghosal combo has so far never failed), to the patriotism Main Kahin Bhi Rahoon (although 13 minutes, it never bored the audience), and the heart-rending Ek Saathi Aur Bhi (easily the best song in the album and Sonu Nigam deserve the award for this song), those four songs easily made LOC-Kargil one of the best soundtracks in this decade. The only liability of this soundtrack is Khush Rehan, as it may not appeal to certain audience. Although LOC-Kargil may have flopped at the box-office, but the songs is nothing less than amazing.

### 95 - Saraswatichandra (1968)

**Music**: Kalyanji-Anandji<br />
**Lyrics**:

Saraswatichandra won the National Award for Best Music, and it deserve it. Kalyanji-Anandji came up with a musical gem that
the songs are still remembered up to this day. Easily, one of Mukesh’s best song has to be Chanchal Sa Badan, as it became a evergreen class. Phool Tumhe Bheja Hai has to be ranked as one of the greatest love duet in Bollywood history. Sau Saal Pahle is a track that will be liked by everyone, while Wada Humse Kiya will appeal to certain people. Lata Mangeshkar renditions make Main To Bhool Chali a memorable song. Mukesh, once again shines in his Humne Apna Sab Kuchh, which became a Hit track, while Lata Mangeshkar rendition Chhod De Saari is simply outstanding. Saraswatichandra is a great album that has become underrated throughout the years in Bollywood. Thankfully, the album won a National Award for Best Music.

### 94 - Kaante (2002)

**Music**: Anand Raaj Anand, Lucky Ali, Vishal-Shekhar<br />
**Lyrics**: Dev Kohli, Anand Raaj Anand, Lucky Ali, & Vishal

This was an album that was strictly for the youth, and it became a rage thanks to foot-tapping music. However, there is something special about Kaante music that it still is popular to this day. One prime example is Ishq Samundar, which was a super-hit track that will have your foot tapping from the moment the song begins. Another popular track was Maahi Ve and it’s still popular to this day. The best song is simply Rama Re, as not only is the music noteworthy, but the lyrics are simply superb because it suits the mood and theme of the film. The two mandatory love tracks in Kaante album are Yaar Mangiyasi, and Dil Kya Kare, however there is nothing special about it. Chhod Na Re was very popular at that time, while Socha Nahin Tha is a memorable song thanks to wonderful picturization in the film. Maut, composed and sung by Lucky Ali, is a dark song that will appeal to certain fans. The only letdown is Baby Baby, which is plain average. Kaante can be said to an experiment album; however the album does succeed by having some noteworthy tunes.

### 93 - Mother India (1957)

**Music**: Naushad<br />
**Lyrics**: Shakeel Badayuni

Mother India was one of the best films, probably the best film ever made in Bollywood history. So for sure, the music had to be atleast good. Naushad is one music director that you can count to deliver a good soundtrack, and Mother India is a great soundtrack. Dukh Bhare Din Beete is a great song, thanks to its music composition, to the lyrics, and its singing. Duniya Mein Hum is an amazing track as the picturisation of this song was excellent. Lata Mangeshkat shines in Ghunghat Nahin Kholungi, although the musical composition was simply average. A memorable Holi song is Holi Aaye Re, while Matwala Jaya is superb duet song. Mohd. Rafi delivers in Na Main Bhagawan Hoon, with very clever lyrics from Shakeel Badayuni. The best song in Mother India is Nagare Nagare Dware Dware, as Lata Mangeshkar is simply great in this song. The ‘average’ tracks in this album are O Gadiwale, O Mere Lal Aaja, and Pee Ke Ghar Aaj. Overall, Mother India is another achievement for Naushad.

### 92 - Anari (1959)

**Music**: Shankar-Jaikishen<br />
**Lyrics**:

Winner of Filmfare Award for Best Music in 1959, Anari was a memorable soundtrack for any Raj Kapoor or Shankar-Jaikishen fans. Dil Ki Nazar Se is one prime example as it has superb singing from Lata Mangeshkar and Mukesh. Kisi Ki Muskurahaton Pe is a memorable track as its your typical perfect Raj Kapoor song. The only song that will appeal to certain audience is Nineteen Fifty Six. Hit songs, is what you can describe the rest of Anari soundtrack. Sub Kuchh Seekha, Tera Jana, Ban Ke Panchhi and Woh Chand Khila were all Hit tracks back in 1959. Well, Shankar-Jaikishen – Raj Kapoor has never disappoint, as all their albums have amazing music, and its not surprising that Shankar-Jaikishen got an award for this album. Anari is a great album nonetheless.

### 91 - Woh Kaun Thi? (1964)

**Music**: Madan Mohan<br />
**Lyrics**:

Raj Khosla – Madan Mohan was an association that has always worked when it came to good music. Their best score was simply
Woh Kaun Thi?, as the music scores are simply timeless. A timeless song was one of Lata Mangeshkar best song ‘Naina Barse Rhim Jhim’, as it’s a haunting number that still appeals to this day. It makes you think, why doesn’t Bollywood make songs like this these days. The best song in this album is Lag Ja Gale, as everything in this song is amazing, Lata Mangeshkar shines once again in another great song in this album is Jo Humne Dastaan Apni. Chhod Kar Tere Pyar Ke is you mandatory love duet while Asha Bhosle makes an impact with Shokh Nazar Ki, as she is brilliant. The last song is average with Tiki Riki Tiki Riki. Woh Kaun Thi is a score that should appeal to everyone to this day, and it’s no surprise that this soundtrack is a classic to this day.

### 90 - Love Story (1981)

**Music**: R.D. Burman<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

R.D. Burman always tends to make music that would please the youth crowd. Love Story was a prime example of that, and boy, did he make an impact with this album. Love Story was one of the top ten selling albums of the 1980s. The first song is an evergreen classic, which is Yaad Aa Rahi Hai, which has excellent singing from Amit Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar. Dekho Maine Dekha Hai Ek Sapna is another Hit song that was quite popular in those days. Asha Bhosle shines once again with Kya Gahzab Karte. My personal favorite is Kaisa Tera Pyar as a beautiful duet from Amit Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar. The last song is a bit annoying, which is Yeh Ladki Zarasi Deewani. Love Story is worth buying thanks to some great numbers in it and it has that special RD Burman charm that he leaves in most of his albums.

### 89 - Saagar (1985)

**Music**: R.D. Burman<br />
**Lyrics**: Javed Akhtar & S.P. Balasubramanyam

Throughout his whole years in Bollywood, R.D. Burman has given so many memorable albums, and Saagar is one of his biggest achievements. The songs from Saagar are very memorable, that its still being hear from your average listeners. One of the biggest selling album of 1985, the biggest factor of this soundtrack was its melody. A prime example of this is Jaane Do Na, is its one of the most seductive song in Bollywood history, as its still popular to this day, and it shows why. Other great songs were Oh Maria, Saagar Jaise Aankhon, Yunhi Gata Raho, Sach Mere Yaar Hai. However, the best song in Saagar was simply Saagar Kinare, as it has to be ranked one of the best romantic songs ever in Bollywood. Kishore Kumar picked up his last Filmfare Award for this song, and he deserve it. Easily a rewind candidate. Saagar is one of R.D. Burman best albums, and it truly shows after nearly 20 years.

### 88 - Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai (1960)

**Music**: Shankar-Jaikishen<br />
**Lyrics**: Shailendra

Raj Kapoor is one director who always has a good music score in his film, so Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai comes to no surprise. The score for this classic film is simply mesmerizing to say the least. And always, Shankar-Jaikishen always gives Raj Kapoor movies memorable songs. The album starts on a promising with Aa Ab Laut Chalen, while Begani Shaadi Mein is typical fun, love song. One of my personal favorite is Hum Bhi Hain, which has the musical composition stands out in this song. Another hit song was the title track, Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai, which is the music composition, is soft, but enjoyable. Mera Naam Raju is another great track, while myy personal favorite is O Basanti, which is an excellent track from Lata Mangeshkar, which will appeal to everyone. The last two songs O Maine Pyar Kiya and Kyua Hua are absolute gems in their own right. The Shankar-Jaikishen – Raj Kapoor duo are simply unstoppable in terms of great music, so Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai comes to no surprise.

### 87 - Gupt (1997)

**Music**: Viju Shah<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

Viju Shah always leaves his best for a Rajiv Rai film, and Gupt was no exception. A soundtrack that rocked India the day it was released in the music market. It was definitely one of the best soundtracks of 1997 and the album up to this day is popular thanks to its rocking tracks. The title song Gupt Gupt is simply amazing to say the least. The thing that stands out is its music arrangement as its simply fantastic, which made this song an instant chartbuster. Another song that was popular (and still is) is Mere Khabo Mein Tu which is your perfect love duet that will appeal to everyone. Musical arrangements continue to dominate this album and Yeh Pyaar Kya Hai is another example of that. Things get even better with the seductive Yeh Pyaasi Jawani as it has Alka Yagnik at her seductive best. The best song in this album is simply Mushkil Bada Yeh Pyar Hai as it’s a Super-Duper Hit track with great music beats. Another Hit song was Duniya Haseeno Ka Mela, as it could become a Bobby Deol entrance song. The only letdown was Mere Sanam Mujhko as it will appeal certain people, as it’s your regular love duet. If you don’t have Gupt CD, please get it, I’m sure you love it as the years goes by, I have.

### 86 - Suraj (1966)

**Lyrics**: Santosh Anand, Pt. Narendra Sharma, Amir Qazalbash

Raj Kapoor is always one director who tends to have great music in his movies. Prem Rog is definitely no exception, since it was the highest selling album of 1982.

There’s no deny that Lata Mangeshkar and Suresh Wadkar are in excellent form in the song. Since it’s a Raj Kapoor film, the soundtrack will always have good quality. So please, get Prem Rog and enjoy it.

### 84 - Don (1978)

**Music**: Kalyanji-Anandji<br />

Don was one of the best albums in the 1970s because it has all the ingredients to appeal to the masses. During the Amitabh Bachchan era, his movies always had that one hit song, however with Don, the songs ranges from Hit to Super-Hit. A prefect example of a classic Super-Hit song was ‘Khaike Paan Banaraswala’, a song that can make anybody dance up to this day.

Back in 1999, Taal is unquestionably the most eagerly awaited Hindi film album of the year. Ghai has said numerous times that Taal has the best music than any of his previous film.

To the unforgettable Chand Chhupa, to the dazzling Nimboda, to the melodious Aankhon Ki Gustakhiyan, to the percussive Man Mohini, to the haunting Jhonka Hawa Ka, to the foot-tapping Dholi Taro Dhol, to the brilliant Tadap Tadap, to the outstanding title track, and the likeable Albela Sajan, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam is truly cherishable. Along with Taal, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam was a perfect album to end of the century.

### 34 - Lagaan (2001)

**Music**: AR Rehman<br />
**Lyrics**: Javed Akthar

Lagaan is the best musical album so far for this decade. AR Rehman came up with an album that is a winner by all standards. From the excellent lyrics, to the wonderful singing and superb music compositions, each and every song from Lagaan is a gem. From the exhilarating Ghanan Ghanan, to the powerful Mitwa, to the melodious Chale Chalo, to the romantic O Rey Chhori, to the wonderful Radha Kaise Na Jale, and the brilliant bhajan O Paalanhaare, any way you look at it, Lagaan music is truly a masterpiece. No doubt, AR Rehman truly deserves the music awards he got for Lagaan.

### 33 - Dil To Pagal Hai (1997)

**Music**: Uttam Singh<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

Once again, a Yash Chopra film made it to the list. Like what I said, if there is one department a Yash Chopra can never fail on, it’s the music. Winner of the Best Music Award in 1997, Uttam Singh gave his best album till date, probably the only album he will be remembered for. What was special about Dil To Pagal Hai album? Well, from the nice title track, to the rhythmical Are Re Are, to the creative Bholi Si Surat, to the romantic Dholna, to the noteworthy Pyar Kar, to the notable Chak Dum Dum, to the classy title track, and the addictive Le Gayi Le Gayi, the music is splendid and it became one of the top selling albums in Bollywood history. It was the best album in 1997.

### 32 - Dosti (1964)

**Music**: Laxmikant-Pyarelal<br />
**Lyrics**: Majrooh Sultanpuri

Dosti is one film Laxmikant-Pyarelal will always be remember for. For one, it was Dosti that they earned their first ever Best Music award in 1964. Laxmikant-Pyarelal relies solely on melody, and Majrooh Sultanpuri’s excellent lyrics. With, Meri Dosti Mera Pyar being the most admired, and Awaaz Mein Na Doonga being the best, Dosti music is marvelous which ever way you look at it. The other Super-Hit tracks were Rahi Manwa, Mere To Jo Bhi Qadam, Gudiya Kab Tak Na Hasogi, and Jaanewalo Zara, all the songs were meaningful and it had an extremely touching score that can soften our hearts. The Rajshri production unit has rarely let us down in terms of music and has never underestimated the power of excellent tunes

### 31 - Waqt (1965)

**Music**: Ravi<br />
**Lyrics**: Sahir Ludhianvi

Ravi’s music towards the classic Waqt played a huge role in its film success. In fact, it’s among the top ten selling album of the 60s. From the evergreen Ae Mere Zohrajabeen, to the romantic Din Hai Bahar Ke, to the soulful Aage Bhi Jaane Na Tu, to the lovely Chehre Pe Khushi, to the brilliant Kaun Aaya, and the attractive Hum Jab Simat Ke, almost every song from Waqt album is still hummable till this day. Waqt is a major achievement for composer Ravi and filmmaker Yash Chopra.

### 30 - Baiju Bawra (1952)

**Music**: Naushad<br />
**Lyrics**: Shakeel Badayuni

Many of Naushad fans regard Baiju Bawra as his best ever, and they have a point. Naushad contribution towards Baiju Bawra made the film a huge success, and it earned Naushad the first-ever Best Music Director award. From Bachpan Ki Mohabbat, Door Koi Gaye, Jhoole Mein Pawan Ke Aayi, Man Tarpat Hai Darshan, Mohe Bhool Gaye Sanwariya, O Duniya Ke Rakhwale and Tu Ganga Ki Mauj, every song was classic material, which made Baiju Bawra the second best selling soundtrack in the 50s. Truly, an album who loves classical music.

### 29 - Hum Aapke Hain Koun (1994)

**Music**: Raam-Laxman<br />
**Lyrics**: Ravinder Rawal, Dev Kohli

It’s true when they say that no wedding celebrations can be complete without the songs from the Blockbuster Hum Aapke Hain Koun. Raam-Laxman, in those days, gave the Barjatyas wonderful musical score, and it comes to no shock that Hum Aapke Hain Koun is ranked amongst its best. Every song from Hum Aapke Hain Koun was Super-Hit material, which the album sold over a crore copies. Didi Tera Devar, Wah Wah Ramji, Samdhi Samdhan, Joote Dedo Paise Lelo, Dhiktana, Maaye Ni Maaye, Chocolate Lime Juice, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, Yeh Mausam Ka Jaadu, Pehla Pehla Pyar Hai, Lo Chali Main, each of these songs were popular in its own right. Raam-Laxman and Barjatyas score once again with Hum Aapke Hain Koun after the super success of Maine Pyar Kiya.

### 28 - Naya Daur (1957)

**Music**: OP Nayyar<br />
**Lyrics**: Sahir Ludhianvi

Back in 1957, Times Of India mentioned that the true hero of the classic film Naya Daur was OP Nayyar for coming up with an excellent music score in Naya Daur. Winner of the Best Music Award in 1957, Naya Daur musical score is considered to be a classic today, as every song is Hit material. The evergreens include Ude Jab Jab Zulfen, Aana Hai To Aa, Saathi Haath Badhaana, Maang Ke Saath Tumhara, Yeh Desh Hai Veer Jawaanon, Reshmi Salwar Kurta Jaali and Main Bombai Ka Babu. Naya Daur was among the top selling soundtracks in the 50s, and with a score like this, it comes to no surprise.

### 27 - Roti Kapada Aur Makaan (1974)

**Music**: Laxmikant-Pyarelal<br />
**Lyrics**: Varma Malik, Santosh Anand

Like Guru Dutt’s Pyaasa, Roti Kapada Aur Makaan is Manoj Kumar best album till date. The album of Roti Kapada Aur Makaan was extremely popular back in the 70s, and the songs are still loved to this day. Every song from Main Na Bhoolunga (being one of the greatest love duets ever in Bollywood), Aur Nahin Bas Aur Nahin, Mehangai Maar Gayi, Haye Haye Yeh Majboori and Panditji Mere Marne Ke Baad were all chartbuster material. After 30 years, Roti Kapada Aur Makaan songs remain a timeless classic and were the fifth top selling album of the 70s. Quite an achievement.

### 26 - Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977)

**Music**: RD Burman<br />
**Lyrics**: Majrooh Sultanpuri

Once again, the RD Burman-Nasir Hussain pair strikes again with their blockbuster album Hum Kisise Kum Naheen. The great thing about this album was that it was ahead of its times (in terms of the western beats was used), and it had many hummable tunes. Even watching Main Hoon Na, you can see that Farah Khan used to the songs of Hum Kisise Kum Naheen in the background. That’s the best part of Hum Kisise Kum Naheen album, it’s an evergreen album that can be played throughout the years and people will not get sick of it. To the classic Kya Hua Tera Vaada, to the romantic Chand Mera Dil, to the energetic Tum Kya Jaano, to the brilliant title track, to the lively Mil Gaya, to the dazzling Bachna Ae Haseeno, to the wonderful Yeh Ladki Haye Allah, and the above average Humko To Yaari, RD Burman music is pure brilliance. It definitely was amongst the top selling album of the 70s.

### 25 - Amar Akbar Anthony (1977)

**Music**: Laxmikant-Pyarelal<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

Amar Akbar Anthony was one of the most complete albums of the 70s. In fact, it ranks as one of the best Laxmikant-Pyarelal album. The biggest asset of Amar Akbar Anthony album is that it’s an album for the masses. From the massy Amar Akbar Anthony, to the full of life qawaali Pardah Hai Pardah, to the wonderful devotion Shirdi Wale Sai Baba, to the situational Tayyab Ali Pyar Ka Dushman, to the energetic rip-roaring My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves, and the wonderful love duet Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai, Amar Akbar Anthony was a great album whichever way you look at it. No wonder why it won Best Music at the Filmfare Awards and it was amongst the top ten best selling albums in the 70s.

### 24 - Umrao Jaan (1981)

**Music**: Khayyam<br />
**Lyrics**: Shahryar

Khayyam has done some great Bollywood soundtracks in his career, but there is something about Umrao Jaan that is makes it special and unique, which is why it’s a timeless album after 26 years of its release. Asha Bhosle provides the vocals for Rekha in this album, and one has to say that each song she sings is amazing. From the evergreen Dil Cheez Kya Hai Aap Meri, to the mind-blowing In Aankhon Ki Masti, to the wonderful Yeh Kya Jagah Hai Doston, to the brilliant Justajoo Jiski Thi, to the dazzling Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm, to the classical Pratham Dhar, to the sweetful Jhoola Kinne Daala and the situational Kahe Ko Byahi, Umrao Jaan is one of the best albums to come out in the 80s. Umrao Jaan’s album is a must for all musical lovers.

### 23 - Muqaddar Ka Sikandar (1978)

**Music**: Kalyanji-Anandji<br />
**Lyrics**: Prakash Mehra & Anjaan

When one hears of the classic Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, you remember numerous things, however the stand out ones are Amitabh Bachchan superb performance, Rekha dancing to Salaam-E-Ishq and Kalyanji-Anandji wonderful music score. Some might call this album to be Kalyanji-Anandji best score till date, and honestly, one can argue that. Take probably the best and most popular mujra song of all-times Salaam-E-Ishq, everything about this song is flawless, from the singing to the lyrics and the music composition. The other beautiful compositions in this album are O Saathi Re Tere Bina, Rote Hue Aate Hain, Dil To Hai Dil, Pyar Zinadgi Hai, and Wafa Jo. Muqaddar Ka Sikandar has to be ranked as one of the best albums for an Amitabh Bachchan starrer, and was one of best selling albums in the 70s. A magnificent album in its own right.

### 22 - Silsila (1981)

**Music**: Shiv-Hari<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

Once again, our favorite romantic director Yash Chopra has another classic soundtrack in the list in the form of Silsila. If I’m not mistaken, this is Shiv-Hari first score in Bollywood, and with this soundtrack, it’s a spectacular effort. Every song is a classic in its own right. Rang Barse still remains the best Holi song ever in Hindi cinema, in fact, when Holi is celebrated around the world, its essential that Rang Barse must be played. The other classic songs in Silsila were Yeh Kahan Aaye Gaye Hum, Sar Se Sarke, Neela Aasman, Ladki Hai Shola, Jo Tum Todo Piya, and Dekha Ek Khwab. In fact, Dekha Ek Khwab is one the greatest duets to ever hit Bollywood. No doubt, Silsila remains Shiv-Hari most memorable score till date.

### 21 - Nagin (1954)

**Music**: Hemant Kumar<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

What makes Nagin (1954) memorable was its wonderful music. Hemant Kumar came up with a score that perfectly blends into the theme of the film. Man Dole Mera Tan Dole is easily the best song of the film. In fact, the song was so popular that real snake charmers would use the music of that song in their performance. The other winners in this album were Jaduagar Saiyan, Tere Dwar Khada, Sun Rasiya, Mera Dil Yeh Pukare Aaja, O Zindagi Ke Dene Wale, Sun Ri Sakhi, Are Chhod De Patang, Mera Badli Mein Chhup, Teri Yaad Mein Jalkar, Are Chhod De Sajaniya, and Oonchi Oonchi Duniya. The beauty of Nagin album was that it fits into the narrative of the film perfectly. Nagin remains Hemant Kumar’s best album till date, which is why it was a top seller in the 50s.

### 20 - Laila Majnu (1976)

**Music**: Madan Mohan<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

I can honestly say that the most underrated soundtrack in the 70s was Laila Majnu. In my opinion, this was Madan Mohan best score till date, and it was completely overshadowed at the award function. Come on, not one nomination for this wonderful soundtrack. Every song from Laila Majnu is a gem. From the classic Husn Hazir Hai, to the wonderful Tere Dar Pe Aaya Hoon, to the superb qawaali Hoke Mayus Tere Dar, to one of most beautiful duets of all-times Is Reshmi Pazeb, to the poignant Ab Agar Hum Se Khudai Bhi, to the excellent Yeh Deewane Ki Zid Hai, to the soulful Barbad-E-Mohabbat Ki Dua, and the touchful Likhkhar Tera Naam, Laila Majnu is an winner anyway you look at it. Its surprising to note that all though Kabhi Kabhie, which released the same year, was more popular album till this date, however Laila Majnu album recorded better sales than Kabhi Kabhie. An album to cherish, which will be loved by everyone.

### 19 - Chori Chori (1956)

**Music**: Shankar-Jaikishan<br />
**Lyrics**: Shailendra & Hasrat Jaipuri

One can honestly say that Shankar-Jaikishan ruled the 50s when it came down to quality albums. Chori Chori is another feather in their cap as almost every song is first-rate. Although Chori Chori remains the last film of Raj Kapoor and Nargis together as a pair, it was its music of Chori Chori that makes Chori Chori popular. Aaja Sanam Madhur, Rasik Balma, Man Bhaanwan Ke Ghar, Jahan Main Jaati, Yeh Raat Bheegi Bheegi, Panchhi Banu Udti, Sawa Lakh Ki Lottery, Is Paar Saajan are what makes Chori Chori a superior album. Another huge achievement from the Shankar-Jaikishan duo.

### 18 - Junglee (1961)

**Music**: Shankar-Jaikishan<br />
**Lyrics**: Shailendra & Hasrat Jaipuri

The Shanker-Jaikishan – Shammi Kapoor combo had many memorable soundtracks, but Junglee remains their best work till date. It seems Junglee soundtrack still gets more popular as the days goes. Songs like Ehsaan Tera Hoga and Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe were huge hits back in 1961 and still remain popular till this date. But, the overall soundtrack is simply great from the start of the soundtrack. The other noteworthy numbers in this album are Kashmir Ki Kali Hoon Main, Aai Aai Sukoo Sukoo, Din Sara Guzara, and Nain Tumhare Mazedar. Junglee remains one of the best soundtracks in the 60s, which is why it was one of the best sellers in the 60s.

### 17 - Bobby (1973)

**Music**: Laxmikant-Pyarelal<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi, Indrajit Singh Tulsi & Vithalbhai Patel

No one would’ve expected both the music soundtrack and movie to be huge Hits. Yes, it was an RK Film, and Raj Kapoor was directing it, but it starred Rishi Kapoor who was making his full role debut in a film after Mera Naam Joker, and you also had Dimple Kapadia making her debut. So one can say that Raj Kapoor was taking a risk by casting two new stars. However, Laxmikant-Pyarelal came up with a memorable score which had tremendous appeal to the youth, which is why Bobby is the number one selling soundtrack in the 70s. Main Shayar To Nahin, Hum Tum Ek Kamre, Beshak Mandir Masjid, Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai, Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kate, Ankhiyon Ke Rehne Do, Ae Phasa became a craze at that time. With Bobby album, Narenda Chanchal and Shailendra Singh became a household name, and Bobby had some evergreen tunes, which is still popular after 35 years of its release.

### 16 - Saajan (1991)

**Music**: Nadeem-Shravan<br />
**Lyrics**: Sameer

Nadeem-Shravan was the best music director in the 90s, as they churned hit albums, one right after the other. A strength in Saajan album is melody, as every song is melodious in its own way. From the amazing score, peotic lyrics from Sameer and wonderful singing that is associated in this album, Saajan is definitely one of the best albums in the 90s. The two best songs in this album are Mera Dil Bhi Kitna Pagal and Jeeye To Jeeye Kaise. These two songs make Saajan album a must-have album. While the former is a wonderful romantic duet, the latter is a soulful song. The other great songs are the chartbuster Dekha Hai Pehli Baar, to the full of energy Tumse Milne Ki Tamanna Hai, to the poetic Bahut Pyar Karte Hain, to the joyful Tu Shayar Hai, and to enjoyable Pehli Baar Mile Hain, Saajan is enjoyable album that got its deserving Best Music award that year. People thought Nadeem-Shravan was a one film wonder when Aashiqui album was released, but with Saajan, they prove they were here to stay. Saajan music should be remembered in the years to come.

### 15 - Shree 420 (1955)

**Music**: Shankar-Jaikishan<br />
**Lyrics**: Shailendra & Hasrat Jaipuri

Come on, it’s an RK Film, especially if Raj Kapoor is going to direct it, you know the music will be nothing but outstanding. Shree 420 proves this theory right. Another reason why Shree 420 album is a classic is because of its simplicity at that time. Each song was a winner in its own right. Mera Jhoota Hai Japani, Ichak Dana Bichak Dana, Ramaiya Vastaviya, Pyar Hua Ikrar Hua, Dil Ka Haal Sune Dilwala, Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh, O Janewale, and Sham Gai Raat Hai remains as gems till this day. Although there were many memorable albums before Shree 420, however, it was this album that created a mark in the overseas, especially in Russia where some of the songs from Shree 420 are still popular in Russia. Albums like this will never die down, it will continue to live.

### 14 - Madhumati (1958)

**Music**: Salil Choudhary<br />
**Lyrics**: Shailendra

The biggest asset of Madhumati was its magnificent score from Salil Chowdhary. Just like Nagin (1954) where both films were a thriller, the music blends efficiently into the theme of the film. Why Madhumati album remains memorable is its innocence. From the haunting Aaja Re Pardesi, to the wonderful Dil Tadap Tadap Ke, to the superb Toote Hue Khwabon Ne, to the innocent Suhana Safar, to the excellent Chadh Gayo Papi Bichhua. The other great songs are Ghadi Ghadi Mora Dil, Zulmi Sang Aankh, Jangal Mein Mor Nacha and Ham Hal-E-Dil Sunaenge. No wonder both the film and the music especially remains unforgettable till this day.

### 13 - 1942 A Love Story (1994)

**Music**: RD Burman<br />
**Lyrics**: Javed Akthar

V. Vinod Chopra films always had great music, but 1942 A Love Story remains his best score till date. It was one of the best music directors of all times, RD Burman last soundtracks, and did he make a lasting impression with this album. Every song was backed with wonderful lyrics from Javed Akthar. From the superbly done Ek Ladki Ko Dekha, to the extraordinary Pyar Hua Chup Kaise, to the playful Rooth Na Jana, to the wonderful Kuch Na Kaho, to the excellent Rhim Jhim and the soulful Yeh Safar, 1942 A Love Story is a album that can be identified from both the masses and classes. We wish we had music directors like RD Burman, who can churn out wonderful albums most of the time.

### 12 - Teesri Manzil (1966)

**Music**: RD Burman<br />
**Lyrics**: Majrooh Sultanpuri

In my opinion, the best RD Burman till date. It was this album that made RD Burman a household name. Yes, we did have a bit of a soft rock songs in the past, but Burman utilize it in a modern way (in those days), and create an album for the masses. To the electrifying O Haseena Zulfon Wali, to the riveting Aaja Aaja Main Hoon Pyar Tera, to the delightful Dekhiye Saahibo Woh Koi, to the wonderful Deewana Mujhsa Nahin, to the heart-warming Tumne Mujhe Dekha, to the classic O Mera Sona Re, Teesri Manzil is an winning album from the first song to the last song. It comes to no surprise as it was the most popular album in 1966, and it was a shame that Filmfare didn’t even nominate Teesri Manzil album in the best music category, as it was the rightful winner.

### 11 - Guide

**Music**: SD Burman<br />
**Lyrics**: Shailendra

Although Guide is a classic till day, it’s the music of Guide which made it unforgettable. Only a maestro like SD Burman, who knows the true value of music, can come up with a memorable score like Guide. Gaata Rahe Mera Dil, Tere Mere Sapne, Din Dhal Jaaye, Piya Tose Naina Laage, Aaj Phir Jeene Ki, Kya Se Kya Ho Gaya, Saiyan Be-Imaan, Wahan Kaun Hai Tera are outstanding in its own right, and you can’t believe that all these great songs are in one album. Disappointed that SD Burman didn’t get the Best Music that year, because Guide album remains an evergreen album and movie till date. I still wonder if there will be another Guide album today in Bollywood.

### 10 - Aradhana (1969)

**Music**: SD Burman<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

One can honestly say that SD Burman best till date is Aradhana. If one were to list the most popular songs in Bollywood history (let’s say 20 best songs), one can bet that Mere Sapnon Ki Rani and Roop Tera Mastana will make it to the list. Even their remixes are very popular. Those two songs scores in every department in terms of singing, lyrics and musical composition. However, there isn’t two winners, but three winners in the album. The other winner is Kora Kagaaz Tha Yeh Man Mera, which is one of the best love duets ever in Bollywood history. Those three songs makes Aradhana a winner already, however Aradhana had other great songs such as Gun Guna Rahe Hain, Baghon Main Bahar, Chanda Hai Tu Mera Suraj and Saphal Ho Tera Aradhana. A movie that shot Rajesh Khanna to stardom and an album that is memorable then and now.

### 9 - Pakeezah (1972)

**Music**: Ghulam Mohammed<br />
**Lyrics**: Majrooh Sultanpuri, Kamal Amrohi, Kaifi Azmi & Kaif Bhopali

One of the greatest classical albums of the 70s was definitely Pakeezah. Pakeezah is an album that has songs that can stir our emotions very well. The music was done by the immense talented Ghulam Mohammed, and it will be fair to say that Pakeezah is his best album till date. Every song from Pakeezah creates a mesmerizing effect on listeners till this date. From the haunting Chalo Dildar Chalo, to the elegant Chalte Chalte, to the wonderful Inhi Log Ne (this is amongst one the best mujras ever in Bollywood history), to the breathtaking Mausam Hai Aashiqana, to the beautiful Nazariya Ki Mari, to the excellent Thare Rahiyo, to the exceptional Mora Sajan, to the awe-inspiring Teer-E-Nazar, and the poignant Kaun Gali, after 35 years, the album still is amazing and like I mentioned before, it stills upto this day creates an mesmerizing effect on listeners. I can’t believe that Filmfare Awards gave Best Music to the average Beimaan album over the classical Pakeezah. Pakeezah is one of the most superior albums ever in Bollywood, and it’s an album that everyone should have.

### 8 - Sangam (1964)

**Music**: Shankar-Jaikishan<br />
**Lyrics**: Shailendra & Hasrat Jaipuri

Another winning soundtrack in the RK camp. Raj Kapoor’s Sangam was not only one of the biggest Hits ever in Indian cinema, but it was the #1 selling soundtrack in the 60s. It was winning score from the first song to the last song. Each song is unique in its own way, and the result of each song is appealing and easy to the ears. From the wonderful Bol Radha Bol, to the romantic Yeh Mera Prem Patra, to the haunting Dost Dost Na Raha, to the beautiful O Mehbooba, to the superb Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega, to the amusing Main Ka Karoon, and the splendid O Mere Sanam, the beauty of Sangam album was its simplicity and the album had a soul, which lacks in today’s soundtrack. It’s sad that the recent RK Films (PremGranth and Aa Ab Laut Chalen) had average scores, because back in the old days when RK Films were releasing, you can bet your money that an RK film will have great soundtrack. Sangam is amongst the top soundtrack in the RK banner and one of the best ever in Bollywood history.

### 7 - Kabhi Kabhie (1976)

**Music**: Khayyam<br />
**Lyrics**: Sahir Ludhianvi

Thirty years after Kabhi Kabhie release, yet the music still lives with us. What makes Kabhi Kabhie album so memorable? Well for one, Khayyam wonderful score. But, the main asset in Kabhi Kabhie that many albums don’t have (especially in today’s time) is its meaningful lyrics. If you have both meaningful lyrics and amazing score, then the album is a winner in all right, and Kabhi Kabhie proves this theory to the fullest. Yash Chopra is one director, after Raj Kapoor, who knows the significance of excellent music. Some people in the younger generation may ask their elders, what do you consider the best bollywood song ever in history? One can bet their money on the line that most answer will be the title track, Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein. Both Mukesh and Lata Mangeshkar rendition is superb and Sahir lyrics are meaningful. Khayyam gives us a memorable tune that will be remembered in film history. Other gems are the beautiful Tere Chehre Se, to the beautiful Surkh Jodeki Yeh, to the simple, Mere Ghar Aaye Ek Nanhi, to the evergreen Main Pal…Do Pal, to the melodious Pyar Karliya To Kya, and the tuneful Chahe Chale Churiya, Kabhi Kabhie can easily be ranked as probably the best album to ever come out in the 70s.

### 6 - Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (1995)

**Music**: Jatin-Lalit<br />
**Lyrics**: Anand Bakshi

A Yash Chopra film can never go wrong on their music. While some of their films weren’t good, their music score ranges from decent to excellent, depending on the film. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge is their crowning glory. Jatin-Lalit scores the music in this film, and they came up with a superb album with today, it still lingers in people mind. Easily the best song in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge is Tujhe Dekha To. It’s easily being ranked as one of the best duets ever in Bollywood history. The other gems in this album are Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna, Ruk Jaa O Dil, Mere Khwabon Mein, Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To, Zara Sa Jhoom, and Ghar Aaya Mera Pardesi. No wonder why the Chopras can never go wrong on their music as they always get it right.

### 5 - Maine Pyar Kiya (1989)

**Music**: Raam Laxman<br />
**Lyrics**: Asad Bhopali & Dev Kohli

Barjatyas, most of the time, always has excellent and sweet music. While their film is targeted at family audiences, their other asset is their music. When one looks down the years as the best Barjatyas musical album, Maine Pyar Kiya is that album. Maine Pyar Kiya was released in the last month of 1989, before hitting the 90s decade. And Maine Pyar Kiya has made a huge impact. For one, not only was it the biggest hit of 1989, it’s the biggest hit in the 80s decade. Two, it was the highest selling album in the 80s, which will appeal every age group. Three, it was the beginning of one of the biggest superstar of all-time Salman Khan. Dil Deewana is the piece-to-resistance of this album. Both Lata Mangeshkar and SP Balasubrhmanium sing their version superbly. One of the best songs to ever come out in Bollywood. The other winners in this album are Kabootar Ja Ja, Aaye Mausam Dosti Ki, Maine Pyar Kiya, Mere Rang Mein Rangne Wali, Kahe To He Sajna, and the Antakshri song. Every song is wonderfully done, that you want to hear album a lot of times. The songs are memorable, which make Maine Pyar Kiya one of best soundtracks of all-times.

### 4 - Aashiqui (1990)

**Music**: Nadeem-Shravan<br />
**Lyrics**: Sameer

This is easily the best soundtrack that was released in the 90s and the album that put Nadeem-Shravan into top league. Aashiqui is one of the best romantic soundtracks in Bollywood history that every Bollywood lover can reckon with. Each and every song is special in its own right. One can’t say what was the best song in this album, but the top contenders were Jaane Jigar Janeman, Bas Ek Sanam Chahiye, Nazar Ki Samne and Dheere Dheere Se Meri. Each of those songs are provide with great jhankar beats (a typical trademark from Nadeem-Shravan), wonderful lyrics from Sameer, excellent renditions from Kumar Sanu and Anuradha Paudwal. Those four songs are rewind material due to their great melody. The other great songs in this album are Main Duniya Bhula Doonga, Mera Dil Tere Liye, Tu Meri Zindagi Hai, Dil Ka Aalam and Ab Tere Bin. Nadeem-Shravan and Sameer both deserve a pat on their back for coming up with an classic album that is remember till date. In fact, Aashiqui will still be remembered in the years to come. It’s good to note that Aashiqui is the best selling album of all-times. That’s the magic of Aashiqui.

### 3 - Awaara (1951)

**Music**: Shankar-Jaikishan<br />
**Lyrics**: Hasrat Jaipuri & Shailendra

What’s one thing you remember from any RK Films? It’s likely the wonderful musical score that is associated with it. Almost every RK Films has perfect score, and Awaara is an perfect example of that. To be honest, Awaara is the best musical album in the 50s decade, also it was the top selling album of the 50s. Every song from Awaara is an evergreen. I would consider Ghar Aaya Mera Pardesi to be one of Lata Mangeshkar best song till date, probably in the top 10 list. An instant rewind candidate. Other gems in this album are Dum Bhar Jo Udhar, Awaara Hoon, Hum Tujhse Mohabbat Karke, Jab Se Balam, Ghar Aaye, Ek Bewafa Se Pyar Kiya, Aa Jaao Tadapte Hain Aarman, Ek Do Teen, Tera Bina, and Haiyya Ho Naiyya. We need more scores like Awaara in today’s time, as Awaara remains a classic after 56 years of this release.

### 2 - Mughal-E-Azam (1960)

**Music**: Naushad<br />
**Lyrics**: Shakeel Badayuni

Mughal-E-Azam took ten years or more to be made, and with a grand film like this, you have to make sure each and every component is beyond brilliance. And considering that this is Bollywood, you have to make sure that your music is a winner. Naushad came up with a legendary score which can still be heard till this date. Every song has rich lyrics and will excellent rendition from the sings. From the evergreen Jab Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya, to the classic Mohe Panghat Pe Nandlal, to the haunting Mohabbat Ki Jhoothi, to the poignant Aye Ishq Yeh Sab Duniyawale, to the memorable Teri Mehfil Main Kismat Azmaakar, to the heart-warming Bekas Pe Karam Kijiye, to the unforgettable Aye Mohabbat Zindabad, to the brilliant Yeh Dil Ki Lagi, and the wonderful qawaalis Prem Jogan Ban Ke and Shubh Din Aayo Re. It’s really sad that Mughal-E-Azam didn’t get the Best Music at the Filmfare Award because the soundtrack is very rich and very romantic. Mughal-E-Azam is a treasure album that can be played over and over again.

### 1 - Barsaat (1949)

**Music**: Shankar-Jaikishan<br />
**Lyrics**: Hasrat Jaipuri, Shailendra, Ramesh Shastri & Jalal Mahilabadi

To be honest, this comes to no surprise that the best soundtrack in Bollywood history is the 1949 classic Barsaat. When Barsaat album was released in 1949, it became the highest selling album at that time, plus it was the biggest seller of the 40s decade. Another reason why this album is memorable is that it was Barsaat that gave Hindi cinema greatest singer ever Lata Mangeshkar the launching pad. This is Shankar-Jaikishan first album and upto this day, everyone can still associate with Barsaat. Every song from Barsaat is a classic in its own right. Barsaat utilizes Lata Mangeshkar vocals very well as most of the songs are solo rendition for her. From the memorable Hawa Mein Udta Jaye, to the melodious Jiya Beqarar Hai, to the poignant Barsaat Mein Hum Se Mile, to the irresistible Mujhse Kisise Pyaar Ho Gaya, to the emotional Bichide Huye Pardesi, to the touching Ab Mera Kaun Sahara, and the beautiful Meri Aankhon Mein Bas Gaye. All of Lata Mangeshkar solo track is a perfect ten in my books. The other gems in Barsaat were Mohammed Rafi solo track Mein Zindagi Main Hardam, and the other two tracks were duets that had Mukesh and Lata Mangeshkar providing the vocals, and they were Patli Kumar Hai and Chhod Gaye Balam. Barsaat album changed the face of Bollywood as it launched the greatest singer to ever grace Bollywood, Lata Mangeshkar. It launched one of the famous musicians, Shankar-Jaikishan. Plus, Barsaat gave us some precious songs that will be remembered in the years to come. No wonder Barsaat is the greatest album of all-timegood
