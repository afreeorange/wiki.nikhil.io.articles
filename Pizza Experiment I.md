Ingredients
-----------

-   2 cups King Arthur bread flour
-   1⅓ cup distilled water
-   1 tbsp instant yeast
-   ½ tsp salt

Implements
----------

-   A baking stone
-   Parchment paper
-   PAM cooking oil spray
-   Plastic wrap
-   A pizza peel

Dough Prep
----------

Mix dry ingredients well. Pour water, knead with spoon for a few minutes
until you have a sticky mass and very little flour on bowl sides.

Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise
for an hour.

Once risen, remove wrap, and [fold dough over
itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQHuWDEo3SA) a few times. Cover
again with wrap. Wait for 30 minutes. Probably a good time to turn on
the oven.

Once risen (again), wet your hands slightly and transfer dough to a
lightly floured surface. Divide into two equal portions (or not if you
want a big pizza). Move portions to parchment paper. Now use your hands
to spread the dough to about a ¼ inch thickness. Take your time and
*don't* tease *all* the bubbles out, especially at the outer edges. The
dough will spread out by itself, but will take its own sweet time. Once
you're satisfied with the shape and thickness, leave it alone for 5
minutes.

Oven Prep
---------

Move stone to lowest level possible in oven. Heat to 500F. Once
temperature is reached, wait another 30-40 minutes.

Pizza Prep
----------

Place dough on parchment onto stone. Bake for 6 minutes. Remove. Then
place any ingredients you'd like, and then transfer dough *directly*
onto stone (i.e., no parchment). Bake for 3-4 minutes. Then turn on
broil for 4-5 minutes.

I usually go for a deep brown crust. Once you're happy with how it
looks, remove from oven, let rest for 2 minutes.

Share and enjoy.
