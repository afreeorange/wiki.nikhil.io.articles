The Base Stuff
---------------

* Saut√© oil
    - Can use ghee as well but sunflower seed oil works out best for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Add 'raw' spices: Mustard, bay leaves, fennel, cinnamon sticks, curry leaves
    - This step is meant to flavour the oil
* Add Ginger + Garlic
* Add onions
* Cook until tender/translucent
* Add serrano chilies
* (Maybe) Add tomatoes

Cook until pulpy, reduce heat. You are ready. This is the spice base upon which everything else is layered.

The End Stuff
-------------

I make a lot of rice-related dishes. At the end, I usually add mint and/or coriander leaves.

I wondered how _biriyani_ makers would get a wonderful set of colors in their rice. This is by way of (a) turmeric, and/or (b) food-coloring, and/or (c) saffron.

For each of turmeric and saffron, I separate out ~10% of the cooked rice to 'dye' them. Once dyed, I mix them back into the main dish. Each dye is prepared by simply dissolving the spice in hot water for 15-20 minutes. With saffron, make sure you grind it a little first for more color. Some people swear that hot milk pulls more of the color but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Tamarind Rice
-------------

Put it here since I cook this in one, but you won't need an InstantPot with this recipe.

* The "Base Stuff" minus tomatoes
* Add yellow lentils/_chana dal_
* Add peanuts to roast 'em. These and the lentils will add some crunch to the rice üòç
* Add tamarind paste and turmeric. Adjust these to taste.
* Add pre-cooked rice and mix like a maniac to get an even color
* Add salt to taste
