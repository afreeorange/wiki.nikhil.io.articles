## Ingredients

* 2 cups Dry Lentils, red variety
* 15 oz Canned Diced Tomatoes
* 10 oz Spinach (I prefer fresh, but frozen, drained and thawed, is ok)
* 4 cups Chiken/Vegetable Broth
* 1 Small Onion, uncooked/minced
* 1/4 tsp Ground Ginger
* 1 TBSP Minced Garlic
* 1 TBSP Curry Powder
* 1 tsp Mustard Seed
* 1/2 tsp Ground Cumin
* 1/2 tsp Ground Coriander
* 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper
* 1 TBSP Salt (use less or more as needed)
* 2 tsp Sugar
* 2 tsp Lemon Juice (optional)
* 1/3 cups Cilantro, fresh, minced (optional)

## Preparation

1. Combine all ingredients, except lemon juice and cilantro, in a large pot.
2. Cook on medium-low heat. Simmer until thick and creamy and lentils are soft, about 1 - 1.5 hours.
3. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If desired, stir in lemon juice and cilantro.
