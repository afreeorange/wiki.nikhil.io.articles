### Ingredients

*   2 cups Sushi (or Short Grain) Rice
*   2 cups Water to cook and whatever's needed to rinse the rice
*   2 tbsp Rice Vinegar
*   1 tsp Sugar
*   1 tsp Kosher Salt

### Preparation

Place the rice into a mixing bowl and cover with cool water. Swirl the
rice in the water, pour off and repeat 2 to 3 times or until the water is
clear.

Place the rice and 2 cups of water into a medium saucepan and place over
high heat. Bring to a boil, uncovered. Once it begins to boil, reduce
the hear to the lowest setting and cover. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove
from the heat & let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.

Combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl and microwave 
on high for 30-45 seconds. Transfer the rice into a
large wooden or glass mixing bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Fold
throughly to combine and coat each grain of rice with the mixture. Allow
to cool to room temperature before using to make sushi or sashimi.
