## API

UniFi provides an API which is ill-documented. Here are some resources that helped me do what I wanted with the API:

- [UniFi API Docs (Incomplete)](https://ubntwiki.com/products/software/unifi-controller/api)
- [UniFi API Browser Application](https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-browser)
- [GitHub Gist to enable and disable WiFi](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jcconnell/0ee6c9d5b25c572863e8ffa0a144e54b/raw/c99f6ce56abdd976e464817512d7fa9b0c80df29/unifi_wifi.sh)
