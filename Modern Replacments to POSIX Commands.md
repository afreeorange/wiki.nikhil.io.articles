Note: You'll need to `ssh-add ~/.ssh/key_id` for `gitui` to push to remote on macOS

There's [`uutils/coreutils`](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) which just replaces all GNU Coreutils with Rust reimplemntations ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Seems risky. They do note that "some options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced". I have a lot `bash` scripts that depend on stable implementations and won't be using this one (again, they do note that "differences with GNU are treated as bugs"). Maybe one day.

[`fselect`](https://github.com/jhspetersson/fselect) allows you to search your filesystem with SQL-like queries!

`starship` allows you to customize your `bash` (or other) prompts. Written in Rust and is advertized to be [_blazingly fast_](https://starship.rs/).
