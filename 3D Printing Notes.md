For a lovely little Prusa Mini+ ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Assorted Notes

- Z-axis does not go higher than **145mm**
- If you are not using your 3d printer, park it and COVER IT. Remove the filament and keep it in a sealed plastic bag! Dust is an enemy.
- After a while, lube the printer's arms. Don't overdo it. A little dab is enough. Sewing oil works fine if you run out of the supplied Prusa paste.

### Nozzle Height

- Top: Adjusted the height as it was printing.
- Middle: This led to shit results... height was not small enough.
- Bottom: Ideal height ü•≤
