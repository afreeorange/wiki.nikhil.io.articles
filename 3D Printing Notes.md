For a lovely little Prusa Mini+ ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Assorted Notes

- Z-axis does not go higher than **145mm**
- If you are not using your the printer, unload the filament, _park_ it and _COVER_ it.
- After a while, lube the printer's arms. Don't overdo it. A little dab is enough. Sewing oil works fine if you run out of the supplied Prusa paste.

### Filament

Keep the filament in a sealed plastic bag! Dust is an enemy. I tried [these bags](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QHMSYY3?psc=1) as a way to keep the filament moisture-free. People have reported that they don't do this and just use Ziploc bags with the original dessicant. I am a bit nuts.

### Nozzle Offset

In addition to the bed's flatness, this is a good culprit for shitprints. Right now, I'm rocking **-1.128**.

- Top: Adjusted the height as it was printing.
- Middle: This led to shit results... height was not small enough.
- Bottom: Ideal height ü•≤
