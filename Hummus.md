I love [Oasis](http://oasisfalafel.com/index.html) in Iowa City. I miss
their hummus. Instead of whinging, I decided to make some myself. After
many a failure and garbanzo-sacrifice, I'm happy with this recipe.
People I serve it to are quite pleased as well.

Ingredients
-----------

* 15oz can of garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
* 1/4 cup [tahini](Tahini)
* 2 1/2 - 3 tsp fresh lemon juice
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp water
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 cloves of garlic

Preparation
-----------

Super simple. Fire up your food processor (I used a [Calphalon hand
blender](http://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Electrics-Immersion-Hand-Blender/dp/B005NGQWYE))

1. Blend everything except the beans until you get a nice,
   whitish paste[^lol].
2. Add beans and blend. Should look like shown[^shown]
3. Dust with some paprika.
4. Refrigerate or just, you know, gorge away. Start with the spatula,
   and do not lick sharp things.

Footnotes
---------

[^lol]: The last time I'll ever type "nice" and "whitish paste" 
    in the same sentence...
[^shown]: 'Creamier' hummus is achieved by adding more water. Be careful and
    add small amounts until desired consistency is reached.
