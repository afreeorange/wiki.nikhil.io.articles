I love [Oasis](http://oasisfalafel.com/index.html) in Iowa City. I miss
their hummus. Instead of whinging, I decided to make some myself. After
many a failure and garbanzo-sacrifice, I'm happy with this recipe.
People I've served it to are quite pleased with its result as well.

Ingredients
-----------

-   15oz can of garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
-   ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
-   ¼ cup tahini
-   1 tbsp olive oil
-   2 tbsp water
-   1 tsp cumin
-   1 tsp salt
-   2 cloves of garlic

Preparation
-----------

Super simple. Fire up your food processor (I used a [Calphalon hand
blender](http://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Electrics-Immersion-Hand-Blender/dp/B005NGQWYE))

1.  Blend everything except the beans until you get a nice,
    whitish paste.
2.  Add beans and blend. Should look like shown.
3.  Dust with some paprika.
4.  Refrigerate or just, you know, gorge away. Start with the spatula,
    and do not lick sharp things.
