I love [Oasis](http://oasisfalafel.com/index.html) in Iowa City. I miss
their hummus. Instead of whinging, I decided to make some myself. After
many a failure and garbanzo-sacrifice, I'm happy with this recipe.
People I've served it to are quite pleased with its result as well.

Ingredients
-----------

-   15oz can of garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
-   ¼ cup [tahini](Tahini "wikilink")
-   2½ - 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice
-   1 tbsp olive oil
-   2 tbsp water
-   1 tsp cumin
-   1 tsp salt
-   2 cloves of garlic

Preparation
-----------

Super simple. Fire up your food processor (I used a [Calphalon hand
blender](http://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Electrics-Immersion-Hand-Blender/dp/B005NGQWYE))

1.  Blend everything except the beans until you get a nice,
    whitish paste.
2.  Add beans and blend. Should look like shown[^1]
3.  Dust with some paprika.
4.  Refrigerate or just, you know, gorge away. Start with the spatula,
    and do not lick sharp things.

[^1]: 'Creamier' hummus is achieved by adding more water. Be careful and
    add small amounts until desired consistency is reached.
