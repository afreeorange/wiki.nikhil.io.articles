I love [Oasis](http://oasisfalafel.com/index.html) in Iowa City. I miss
their hummus. Instead of whinging, I decided to make some myself. After
many a failure and garbanzo-sacrifice, I'm happy with this recipe.
People I serve it to are quite pleased as well.

Ingredients
-----------

* 15oz can of chickpeas
* 1/4 cup [tahini](Tahini)
* 2 1/2 - 3 tsp fresh lemon juice
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp water (*use the liquid from the can!*)
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 cloves of garlic

If "liquid from the can" sounds terrible, get some fresh chickpeas and let them soak for 24-36 hours. *Don't throw away the water!* Use it to adjust the hummus' consistency.

Preparation
-----------

Super simple. Fire up your food processor (I used a [Calphalon hand
blender](http://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Electrics-Immersion-Hand-Blender/dp/B005NGQWYE))

1. Blend everything except the beans until you get a nice,
   whitish paste[^lol].
2. Add beans and blend. 
3. Add water gradually. 'Creamier' hummus is achieved by adding more water. Be careful and add small amounts until desired consistency is reached.
4. Dust with some paprika.
5. Refrigerate or just, you know, gorge away. Start with the spatula,
   and do not lick sharp things.

[^lol]: The last time I'll ever type "nice" and "whitish paste" 
    in the same sentence...
