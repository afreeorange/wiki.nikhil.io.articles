Because it's annoying as fuck if you set up wireless printing. I'm assuming a PM at Brother thought this would save the planet.

- Go to **General Setup** -> <kbd>OK</kbd>
- Scroll with arrow keys to **Ecology** -> <kbd>OK</kbd>
- Scroll with arrow keys to **Sleep Time** -> <kbd>OK</kbd>
- Set it to 0 minutes -> <kbd>OK</kbd>
- Now you have to hold _both_ the back button and down button to see the 'secret' **Deep Sleep** option. Turn it off and you'll see "Accepted".
- Hit <kbd>OK</kbd> the appropriate number of times to get back to the main menu

**Update for macOS**

This _still_ does not clear deep sleep _sometimes_. There's apparently a maintenance mode option. I read through their [troubleshooting guide](https://help.brother-usa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/151825/~/unable-to-print-after-the-machine-has-entered-deep-sleep---windows#Recommeded). Then disabled IPv6 and things _appear_ to work.
