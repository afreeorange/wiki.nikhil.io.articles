## [Version One](https://www.salon.com/2009/06/19/ginger_scallion_sauce_recipe/)

* 1 ounce ginger, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
* 1 bunch (about 4 ounces) whole scallions, cut into 1-inch lengths
* 1/2 cup oil, preferably peanut or corn (Avoid olive oil and definitely no canola, which, when heated like * this, smells like a fish. And not in a good way.)
* Salt

### Directions

1. Whirl the ginger in a food processor until it's finely minced, but not pur√©ed (meaning stop before it gets liquidy and pasty). Put it in a wide, tall, heatproof bowl, several times bigger than you think you need. For real. The bowl matters. Use a cooking pot if you have to, because when that oil gets in there, the sizzle is going to be serious business.
2. Mince the scallions in the food processor until they're about the same size as the ginger. Add it to the ginger.
3. Salt the ginger and scallion like they called your mother a bad name and stir it well. Taste it. It won't taste good because that much raw ginger and scallion doesn't really taste good, but pay attention to the saltiness. You want it to be just a little too salty to be pleasant, because you have to account for all the oil you're about to add.
4. Heat the oil in a pan until you just start seeing wisps of smoke, and pour it into the ginger scallion mixture. It's going to sizzle and bubble like a science-fair volcano, and it's going to smell awesome. Don't stick your face in it. You wouldn't stick your face in lava, would you? Give it a light stir with a heatproof spoon.
5. Let cool to room temperature. Keep it in the fridge, for whenever you want to be one spoonful away from deliciousness.

## Version Two - No Drama

* 1 1/2 cups thinly sliced scallions (greens and whites; from 1 to 2 large bunches)
* 1/2 cup finely minced peeled fresh ginger
* 2/4 cup grapeseed or other neutral oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons usukuchi (light soy sauce)
* 2/4 teaspoon sherry vinegar
* 2/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste

Mix together the scallions, ginger, oil, soy, vinegar, and salt in a bowl. Taste and check for salt, adding more if needed.
