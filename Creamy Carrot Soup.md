These are guesstimates. Made this without measuring stuff since I needed to get rid of a batch of carrots. Wish I did now :/

### Ingredients

* 10-15 large carrots, peeled
* 1 tbsp fresh ginger + garlic
* 1 tsp curry powder
* 1 tsp masala powder
* 1 tsp chilli powder
* 3 tsp salt
* 16 oz unsweetened coconut milk
* 16 oz vegetable broth (can use bouillon, maybe)

### Preparation

Used Instant Pot to pressure-cook carrots, with _half_ the broth and all the ginger and garlic, at high pressure for ~10 minutes to get them Gerber Baby Food-soft. Then set to sautÃ© on low and added coconut milk and everything else. PurÃ©e with a hand blender. Deeeeelish.

### To Try

* Try 1/2 tsp each of the curry and masala powders. This thing is a bit spicy.
* Try some turmeric for it's good for you ðŸ’•
