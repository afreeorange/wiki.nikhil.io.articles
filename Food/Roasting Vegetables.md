My new favorite thing. 

### Preparation

Set oven to heat to 425F. In the meanwhile, cut veggies and make sure they're:

1. Coated _well_ in olive oil (spray works if you're lazy)
2. Are spread apart as well as possible
3. Are _at least_ dusted with salt and pepper

You can add other awesome things like paprika, a bit of turmeric, red chili powder, basil, _rosemary_... whatever you'd like!

Now bake them for a good 25 minutes. Then check on them and turn them over. Bake for another 10-15 minutes. They should have given up a good deal of moisture and be shriveled. I like crispy edges ðŸ˜‹. You do you.

### A Table

Found this on my internet searches. I cook all my veggies in a medley and haven't yet had the time to try these recommendations.
