## Ingredients

* 2 cans of Chaokoh coconut milk (400ml)
* 1 tin of Maesri paste (228g)
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp lime
* 2 tsp salt

## Preparation

**Veggies**: Drop frozen veggies in Instant Pot. Add 1/2 cup of water. Set the timer to `00:00` and cook at high pressure. Use colander to drain any water.

**Curry**: _Do not shake coconut milk can_! Pour the top half into the InstantPot. Saute on normal heat and reduce the milk. It should be really thick. See [this video](https://youtu.be/LIbKVpBQKJI?t=114) for some reference of what it should look like. When the milk is reduced, add the Maesri paste. Cook until you get a nice oily separation ♥️

Add the veggies and saute for a minute or two. Add all the remaining coconut milk, salt, sugar, lime and turn off the heat.

## Results, Notes, TODO

Needed to add 1/2 a cup of water. This is not bad at all. Not sure what I'd do next. Will mess with kaffir leaves and galangal the next time.
