## Ingredients

* 5 cans of Chaokoh coconut milk (400ml)
* 2 tins of Maesri paste (228g)
* 1 can of water
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tbsp tamarind
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp lime

## Preparation

Used half of one unshaken can to separate out the oils. Added the rest with other stuff. Boiled until veggies were adequately cooked. 

## Results, Notes, TODO

* This was shit; insipid
* Veggies were overcooked
* Curry was _way_ too thick still
* I will eat all of it, however

### TODO

* Looks like 114g paste to an _average_ of 600ml of coconut milk
  * This is one tin of 
  * This varies by paste; each paste has it's own prep method
* Still, use 200ml of milk with the paste and separate out the oils very well before you do anything
* Bought lime leaves to try out later
