## Ingredients

* 2 Maesri tins
* 5 cans of Chaokoh
* 4 tbsp Brown Sugar
* 2 tbsp Lime Juice
* 1 tbsp Tamarind

## Preparation

Used the fat from the can to create a thick paste where the oil from the coconut milk separated visibly (and much to my delight.) Added the rest of the cans after there was enough oil-separation, brought to a low boil, then added some saut√©ed mushrooms and bok choy.

## Results, Notes, TODO

* The taste was _way too intense_.
* There was _way too much_ oil.

### TODO

* Figure out the correct ratio of paste to milk
* Don't overdo the oil/fat separation
* Try to find kaffir leaves
