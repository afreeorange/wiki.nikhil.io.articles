Made this in an InstantPot.

## Ingredients

* 4 cans of [_Thai Kitchen_ organic coconut milk](https://www.amazon.com/Thai-Kitchen-Red-Curry-Paste/dp/B007QR5EPQ)
* 2 little things of [_Thai Kitchen_ Curry Paste](https://www.amazon.com/Thai-Kitchen-Red-Curry-Paste/dp/B007QR5EPQ)
* 3 large peppers (red, yellow, green)
* 1 large onion
* 1 large potato
* 1 tbsp fish sauce (shitty brand)
* 3 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tbsp lime juice

## Preparation

Sauteed the paste on low for about 2-3 minutes. Added the milk, switched to high and brought things to a boil. Added veggies and other ingredients, gave the mix a nice stir, and pressure cooked on low for 5 mins.

**Note**: Keep the last can out and add it before you pressure cook so that you bring the temperature down. This avoids a `BURN` on the InstantPot...

## Results, Notes, TODO

Veggies were not _al dente_ as I liked. Decent flavor.

* Use coconut milk with the paste
* Try to separate out the fats from the coconut oil the next time
  * DO NOT SHAKE THE CAN. Use the separated out cream; it's rich in fat
  * Good Thai coconut milk will have about 15-20% fats in it. Use this to develop flavors in the curry paste!
  * Fry the fat, add the paste, reduce until it's about peanut-buttery-ish, then add more milk (and pressure cook the veggies)
* Try 3 mins on low pressure

* Use kaffir leaves
* Try Tamarind
