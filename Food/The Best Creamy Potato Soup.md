I am amazed by how well this first iteration turned out.

### Ingredients

For **each pound** of potatoes,

* 2 cups vegetable broth
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter (healthy option: 1/2 each of olive oil and butter)
* 1 tbsp garlic (yep)
* 2/3 cream (healthy option: coconut milk)
* 1/3 tbsp salt
* 1/3 tbsp pepper
* 1/2 tsp italian seasoning

### Prep

Pressure cook diced potatoes[^skinning] with all ingredients for about 10 minutes. Use a blender ([this is mine](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-924305/calphalon-immersion-hand-blender.jsp)) to pur√©e the mix, adjusting consistency with veggie broth. Stuff face, then refrigerate for another day üíñ

### Future Work

Try [Yukon Gold Potatoes](https://www.myrecipes.com/extracrispy/whats-the-difference-between-russet-red-and-yukon-gold-potatoes). The color's not very 'bright' which might be due to the skins and the vegetable broth.

[^skinning]: You may or may not choose to skin them first ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
