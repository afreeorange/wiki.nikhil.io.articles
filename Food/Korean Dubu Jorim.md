### Tofu

Fry large chunks of tofu until they are golden brown on either side.

### Sauce

- 1 tbsp Soy Sauce
- 1 tbsp Hot Pepper Flakes (_Gochugaru_! Taste will be different if you use 'normal' red chili powder!)
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp Sugar
- 1.5 cups water
- Half clove garlic
- Half a large onion

Mix all ingredients except onion and garlic. 

In ginger oil, at medium-high heat, fry the onions. When they start browning, add garlic. Then add the sauce mix. Keep stirring and reduce until you see 'red foam' and the sauce is as thick as you'd like it to be (you can use corn starch here but don't). 

Add the fried tofu and coat all the pieces with the sauce. Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds. 

I added a light amount of BBQ sauce and it was pretty lovely.
