It was [a popular restaurant in Des Moines](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2019/06/01/krunkwich-ramen-house-closed-permanently-sam-auen-tacopocalypse-restaurant-vegan-japanese-ingersoll/1310970001/). See [this Reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/desmoines/comments/bvkogg/krunkwichlos_banditos_gone/) for a discussion about the owner. A former employee [posted these on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/desmoines/comments/yt68cq/krunkwich_recipe_book/). I am caching them here so I can try them out later :)
