Start with a French Press. You don't need to pre-warm the glass by filling it with boiling hot water. Don't be that person.

You'll need fresh, _whole_ coffee beans. You want to grind them coarse. I have [one of these](https://baratza.com/grinder/encore/) and set it to anywhere between 25 to 30.

Start with a 1:6 ratio of beans to water and adjust later.

Place ground beans in the carafe. Heat water to _right below_ boiling (< 212F) and pour it over the ground beans. Place the plunger just over the mouth of the carafe and let it **sit for 2 minutes**.

Then take a fork and remove most (> 80%) of the ground beans. Replace plunger at the mouth of the carafe. You'll then let it **sit for 5 minutes**.

Push plunger down to no resistance whatsoever and enjoy the lovely stuff ☕️ 🥰
