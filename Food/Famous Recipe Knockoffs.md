  1/2 Cup Raisins
  1/4 Cup Soy Sauce
  1/4 Cup White Vinegar
  2 Tbsp Dijon mustard
  1 Tbsp Bottled Grated Orange Peel
  2 Tbsp Heinz Ketchup
  2 Tbsp Heinz Chili Sauce

   1. Bring to a boil for 2 minutes stirring.

   Almond Joy Bars


 Ingredients (26 servings)

   4 c (8 1/2-oz) shredded coconut
 1/4 c Light corn syrup 
   1 pk (11 1/2-oz) milk chocolate pieces 
 1/4 c Vegetable shortening 
  26 Whole natural almonds (1-oz) 


 Line two large cookie sheets with waxed paper. Set large wire cooling rack 
 on paper; set aside.
 
 Place coconut in large bowl; set aside.
 
 Place corn syrup in a 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on high (100%) 1 minute
 or until syrup boils. Immediately pour over coconut. Work warm syrup into 
 coconut using the back of a wooden spoon until coconut is thoroughly coated. 
 This takes a little time, and yes, there is enough syrup.
 
 Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by 
 squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling between both 
 palms. (HINT: Measure out all of the coconut then roll into balls.) Place 2 
 inches apart on wire racks. Let dry 10 minutes. Reroll coconut balls so 
 there are no loose ends of coconut sticking up.
 
 Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4-cup glass measure or 1 1/2 quart
 microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until mixture can 
 be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice. 

 Working quickly, spoon 1 level measuring tablespoon of the chocolate 
 over each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting excess 
 chocolate drip down onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating is still soft, 
 lightly press whole almond on top of each. Let stand to set or place 
 in refrigerator. Store in a single layer in airtight container. 
 Keeps best if refrigerated. Makes 26.  






   Applebee's Lemonade


                            1 Quart water
                            1 Cup sugar
                            1 Cup FRESH lemon juice
             Sparkling Water (not tonic water, like Perrier)

           Mix first three togther. Fill a tall glass 2/3 to 
           3/4 with Lemon mixture then fill with sparkling water.


         An intresting variation is to puree some fruit 
         (raspberries, strawberries, etc) with a little
         superfine or powdered sugar and put that in the
         glass before adding the the lemonade and water.   

Applebee's Low-Fat Blackened Chicken Salad


 Dressing:
  1/4 cup fat free mayonnaise
  1/4 cup Grey Poupon Dijon mustard
  1/4 cup honey
  1 tablespoon prepared mustard
  1 tablespoon white vinegar
  1/8 teaspoon paprika

 Chicken Marinade:
  1 cup water
  3 tablespoons lime juice
  2 tablespoons soy sauce
  1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire

 Cajun Spice Blend:
  1/2 tablespoon salt
  1 teaspoon sugar
  1 teaspoon paprika
  1 teaspoon onion powder
  1 teaspoon black pepper
  1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
  1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
  1/2 teaspoon white pepper

  2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
  2 tablespoons light butter

 Salad:
  8 cups chopped iceberg lettuce
  1/2 cup shredded red cabbage
  1/2 cup shredded carrot
  1/2 cup fat free shredded mozzarella cheese
  1/2 cup fat free shredded cheddar cheese
  1 large tomato, diced
  1 hardboiled egg white, diced

 1. Make dressing by combining ingredients in a small bowl. Mix well by hand.
    Store in a covered container in the refrigerator until salad is ready.

 2. Combine water, lime juice, soy sauce, and Worcestershire in a medium bowl, 
    and stir. Add the chicken breasts to the marinade, cover bowl and keep in 
    refrigerator for several hours. Overnight is even better.

 3. When chicken is marinated, preheat a frying pan or skillet (an iron 
    skillet, if youve got it) over medium/high heat. Also, preheat your 
    barbecue grill to medium/high heat.

 4. Combine the spices for the Cajun spice blend in a small bowl. Sprinkle a 
    teaspoon of the spice blend over one side of each of the chicken breasts. 
    Cover the entire surface of the chicken with spice. 

 5. Melt the butter in the hot pan, then sear the chicken breasts for 2-3 
    minutes on the side with the spices. While first side cooks, sprinkle 
    another teaspoon of spice over the top of each chicken breast, coating 
    that side as you did the other. Flip the chicken over, and sear for 
    another 2-3 minutes. The surface of the chicken will be coated with a
    charred, black layer of flavor. This is exactly what you are shooting for.

 6. Finish the chicken off on your barbecue grill. Grill each breast on 
    both sides for 2-3 minutes, or until they are done.

 7. While chicken is cooking prepare the salads by splitting the lettuce into 
    two large bowls. Toss in the red cabbage and carrots. Mix the cheeses 
    together, then top the salad with the cheeses and hardboiled egg. 
    Sprinkle the diced tomato on each salad.

 8. Slice the chicken breast, across each breast in 1/2-inch-thick slices. 
    Spread the chicken over the top of the salad and serve immediately with 
    dressing on the side.

      1/3 cup chow mein noodles 

   1. Preheat oil in deep fryer or deep pan over medium heat. You want the
      temperature of the oil to be around 350 degrees.

   2. Blend together all ingredients for dressing in a small bowl with an 
      electric mixer. Put dressing in refrigerator to chill while you prepare
      the salad

   3. In a small, shallow bowl beat egg, add milk, and mix well.

   4. In another bowl, combine flour with corn flake crumbs, salt and pepper.

   5. Cut chicken breast into 4 or 5 long strips. Dip each strip of chicken 
      first into egg mixture then into the flour mixture, coating each piece
      completely.

   6. Fry each chicken finger for 5 minutes or until coating has darkened to
      brown.

   7. Prepare salad by tossing the chopped romaine with the chopped red
      cabbage, Napa cabbage, and carrots.

   8. Sprinkle sliced green onion on top of the lettuce.

   9. Sprinkle almonds over the salad, then the chow mein noodles.

  10. Cut the chicken into small bite-size chunks. Place the chicken onto the
      salad forming a pile in the middle. Serve with salad dressing on the 
      side. Makes 1 dinner-size salad.

         1/4 cup   canola oil
         1 Tbl.    honey
         1 Tbl.    lime juice
       1/4 tsp.    paprika
       4 chicken breast halves, washed and patted dry


  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, combine canola oil, honey, 
  lime juice, and paprika. Place chicken, skin side up, in a 7X11 inch baking
  dish. Apply mixture to chicken pieces in a single layer. Bake in oven for
  35-40 minutes, basting every 8-10 minutes, until well browned and juices
  run clear when you cut into the thickest part of the chicken. Remove from 
  oven. Cover with foil for 15 minutes.

Boston Market Meatloaf

 
     1 cup tomato sauce   
     1 1/2 tablespoons Kraft original barbecue sauce
     1 tablespoon granulated sugar
     1 1/2 pounds ground sirloin (10% fat)
     6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
   3/4 teaspoon salt
   1/2 teaspoon onion powder
   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
   dash garlic powder

  1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

  2. Combine the tomato sauce, barbecue sauce and sugar in a small saucepan 
     over medium heat. Heat the mixture until it begins to bubble, stirring 
     often, then remove it from the heat.

  3. In a large bowl, add all but 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce to the 
     meat. Use a large wooden spoon or your hands to work the sauce into the 
     meat until it is very well combined.

  4. Combine the remaining ingredients with the ground sirloin-- flour, salt,
     onion powder and ground pepper. Use the wooden spoon or your hands to 
     work the spices and flour into the meat.

  5. Load the meat into a loaf pan (preferably a meatloaf pan with two 
     sections which allows the fat to drain, but if you don't have one of 
     those a regular loaf pan will work). Wrap foil over the pan and
     place it into the oven for 30 minutes.

  6. After 30 minutes, take the meatloaf from the oven, remove the foil and,
     if you aren't using a meatloaf pan, drain the fat.

  7. Using a knife, slice the meatloaf all the way through into 8 slices 
     while it is still in the pan. This will help to cook the center of the 
     meatloaf. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of sauce over the top of
     the meatloaf, in a stream down the center. Don't spread the sauce.

  8. Place the meatloaf back into the oven, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes or 
     until it is done. Remove and allow it to cool for a few minutes before 
     serving.

     Serves 4.

Carl's Jr. Famous Star


      1    Sesame-seed hamburger bun 
      2    Onion rings 
    1/2 ts Sweet pickle relish 
  1 1/2 ts Catsup 
    1/4 lb Ground beef 
      1 ds Salt 
      2 ts Mayonnaise 
      3    Dill pickle slices 
    1/4 c  Coarsely chopped lettuce 
      2    Tomato slices 
  
  Preheat a clean barbecue grill on high.  Toast both halves of the 
  bun, face down, in a skillet over medium heat.  Set aside. Cut each 
  of the 2 onion rings into quarters.  Mix the catsup and relish 
  together. This is your "secret sauce."  Form the ground beef into a 
  thin patty slightly larger than the bun.  Grill the meat for 2 or 3 
  minutes per side. Salt slightly. Build the burger in the following 
  stacking order from the bottom up: bottom bun, half of the 
  mayonnaise, pickles, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, beef patty, 
  remainder of mayonnaise, special sauce (catsup and relish), top bun. 
     Cheese Nips

      
      1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
      (plus 1/2 cup divided & reserved for kneading and rolling)
      1 teaspoon baking soda
      1/4 teaspoon baking powder
      1/2 cup Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Cheese Topping powder
      (or 2 packages dry cheese powder from 2 boxes Kraft macaroni & cheese)
      3 tablespoons shortening
      1/3 cup buttermilk
      1/2 teaspoon salt (for tops, optional)

   1. Sift together 1 cup flour, baking soda, baking powder and cheese 
      powder in a large bowl.

   2. Cut in the shortening with a fork and knife with a crosswise motion 
      until dough is broken down into rice-size pieces. Mixture will still 
      be very dry.

   3. Stir in buttermilk with a fork until dough becomes very moist and 
      sticky.

   4. Sprinkle a couple tablespoons of the reserved flour over the dough and
      work it in until it can be handled without sticking, then turn it out 
      onto a floured board, being sure to keep 1/4 cup of the reserve flour 
      for later. Knead the dough well for 60 to 90 seconds, and the flour is 
      incorporated. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 
      one hour.

   5. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spray a light coating of cooking spray 
      on a baking sheet.

   6. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and use the remaining reserve
      flour to dust a rolling surface. Roll about one-third of the dough 
      to just under 1/16th of inch thick. Trim the edges square (a pizza 
      cutter or wheel works great for this), then transfer the dough to a 
      lightly greased baking sheet. Use the rolling pin to transfer the 
      dough. Simply pick up one end of the dough onto a rolling pin, and roll 
      the dough around the rolling pin. Reverse the process onto the baking 
      sheet to transfer the dough.

   7. Use a pizza cutter to cut across and down the dough, creating 1-inch
      square pieces. Use the blunt end of a skewer or broken toothpick to 
      poke a hole in the center of each piece.

   8. Sprinkle a very light coating of salt over the top of the crackers 
      (crackers will already be quite salty) and bake for 8-10 minutes, 
      mix the crackers around (so those on the edge dont burn) and bake 
      for another 3-5 minutes, or until some are just barely turning a 
      light brown. Repeat the rolling and baking process with the remaining 
      dough.

      Makes approximately 300 crackers.


   Cheesecake Factory Pumpkin Cheesecake

     
     1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
         5 tablespoons butter, melted
         1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
         3 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
         1 teaspoon vanilla
         1 cup canned pumpkin
         3 eggs
       1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
       1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
       1/4 teaspoon allspice
           whipped cream

   1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

   2. Make the crust by combining the graham cracker crumbs with the melted 
      butter and 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl. Stir well enough to 
      coat all of the crumbs with the butter, but not so much as to turn the 
      mixture into paste. Keep it crumbly.

   3. Press the crumbs onto the bottom and about two-thirds of the way up 
      the sides of a springform pan. You don't want the crust to form all 
      of the way up the back of each slice of cheesecake. Bake the crust 
      for 5 minutes, then set it aside until you are ready to fill it.

   4. In a large mixing bowl combine the cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and 
      vanilla. Mix with an electric mixer until smooth.

   5. Add the pumpkin, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice and continue 
      to beat until smooth and creamy.

   6. Pour the filling into the pan. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes. The top will
      turn a bit darker at this point. Remove from the oven and allow the 
      cheesecake to cool.

   7. When the cheesecake has come to room temperature, put it into the 
      refrigerator. When the cheesecake has chilled, remove the pan sides 
      and cut the cake into 8 equal pieces. Use dental floss to make a
      clean cut. 

      Serve with a generous portion of whipped cream on top.

      Serves 8.

Chi Chi's Sweet Corn Cake


      1/2 cup (1 stick butter), softened
      1/3 cup masa harina (mexican corn flour, usually in Latin American 
            groceries or next to flour. Possibly in Mexican food section)
      1/4 cup water
    1 1/2 cups frozen corn, thawed
      1/4 cup cornmeal
      1/3 cup sugar
        2 tablespoons heavy cream
      1/4 teaspoon salt
      1/2 teaspoons baking powder
 

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  

   Blend butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until creamy.
   Add the masa harina and water to the butter and beat until well combined. 

   Put defrosted corn into a blender or food processor and with short 
   pulses, coarsely chop the corn on low speed. You want to leave several 
   whole pieces of corn. 

   Stir the chopped corn into the butter and masa harina mixture.
   Add cornmeal to mixture and combine. 

   In another medium bowl, mix together the sugar, cream, salt, and 
   baking powder. When the ingredients are well blended, pour the mixture 
   into the other bowl and stir everything together BY HAND. 

   Pour corn batter into an ungreased 8"x8" baking pan. 
   Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Place this pan into a 13"x9" pan
   filled 1/3 of the way up with hot water. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until
   the corn cake is cooked through. When the corn cake is done, remove 
   the small pan from the larger pan and let sit for at least 10 minutes. 

   To serve, scoop out each portion with an ice cream scoop or
   rounded spoon.

Chick-Fil-A Chicken Sandwich


       3 cups Peanut oil
            1 Egg
        1 cup Milk
        1 cup Flour
     2 1/2 tb Powdered sugar
       1/2 ts Pepper
         2 tb Salt
            2 Skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved     
            4 Plain hamburger buns
         2 tb Melted butter
            8 Dill pickle slices

  Heat the peanut oil in a pressure cooker over med. heat to about 400F. In
  a small bowl, beat the egg and stir in the milk. In a separate bowl,
  combine the flour, sugar, pepper, and salt. dip each piece of chicken in
  milk until it is fully moistened. Roll the moistened chicken in the flour
  mixture until completely coated. Drop all four chicken pieces into the hot
  oil and close the pressure cooker. When steam starts shooting through the
  pressure release, set the timer for 3-1/2 minutes. IMPORTANT!!!! 
  DO NOT CLOSE STEAM RELEASE. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS! While the chicken is
  cooking, spread a coating of melted butter on the face of each bun. When
  the chicken is done, remove it from the oil and drain or blot on paper
  towels. Place two pickles on each bottom bun; add a chicken breast, then
  the top bun. To make a deluxe chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato
  slices and a leaf of lettuce. Mayonnaise also goes well on this
  sandwich--it is a side order at the restaurant.

      2 tablespoons sour cream
    1/4 cup diced tomato
    1/2 teaspoon diced jalapeno
    1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro
    1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
    1/8 teaspoon salt

   Chili Queso:
      3 ounces ground beef
      1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
        pinch of salt
        pinch of ground black pepper
     16-ounce bottle Cheez Whiz
      2 tablespoons milk
    1/2 teaspoon chili powder
    1/2 teaspoon cumin
    1/2 teaspoon paprika

        2 pounds ground beef
        4 large sesame seed buns
        2 cups iceberg lettuce, shredded or chopped thin
        2 tablespoons mayonnaise
        1 green onion, chopped
    16-20 tortilla chips
      2-3 fresh jalapenos, sliced

  1. First make the pico de gallo. This is easy. Just combine all of the 
     ingredients for the pico in a small bowl and mix well. Cover bowl and 
     chill in the refrigerator.
  2. Now we'll make the guacamole. In a small bowl, smash up most of the 
     avocado, but be sure to leave several unsmashed chunks. Add the 
     remaining ingredients for the guacamole to the avocado and mix well. 
     Cover bowl and chill in the refrigerator, next to the pico.
  3. Next we'll make the chili queso. In yet another small bowl, mix together
     ground beef, flour, a pinch of salt, a pinch of black pepper, and a 
     pinch of chili powder. Use your hands to work the dry ingredients into 
     the ground beef. Brown the beef in a small skillet over medium heat
     for about 5 minutes. Use a spoon or spatula to crumble the beef as it 
     cooks. Cook until it's brown, then set aside.
  4. Melt the Cheez Whiz with 2 tablespoons of milk over low heat. When milk 
     and cheese has been combined, add the remaining queso ingredients. 
     Heat while stirring often until cheese is smooth and creamy, 
     then cover saucepan and remove it from the heat.
  5. Pre-heat a griddle or large frying pan over medium heat. Lightly butter 
     the face of each bun and brown the buns face-down on the heat.
  6. Separate the ground beef into four 1/2-pound portions. Roll each portion
     of meat into a ball and then pat the meat down into a circular patty

Fiddle Faddle


        3/4 cup granulated sugar
        1/4 cup brown sugar
        1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
        1/2 cup corn syrup
        1/2 cup water
        1/2 teaspoon salt
        1/2 teaspoon vanilla
      1 1/3 bags plain or natural-flavored microwave popcorn
        1/2 cup roasted almonds 

  1. Combine sugar, butter, corn syrup, water and salt in a large saucepan
     over medium heat. You're going to bring the candy to 265-275 degrees, 
     or what is known as the hard ball stage. For this it's best to use a 
     candy thermometer. If you don't have one, don't worry. Drip the candy 
     into a small glass of cold water. If the candy forms a very hard, yet 
     slightly pliable ball, bingo, you're there. Watch your mixture closely 
     so that it doesn't boil over. 

  2. While candy cooks, pop both bags of popcorn and spread about 2 quarts 
     or 1 1/3 bags of popcorn on one large or two small cookie sheets. 
     Put the popcorn in your oven set on its lowest temperature. This will 
     keep the popcorn hot so that the candy will coat better.

  3. When your candy has reached the hard ball stage, add the vanilla.

  4. Pull the popcorn from the oven and, working quickly, pour the candy 
     over the popcorn in thin streams. Mix the popcorn so that each kernel 
     is coated with candy, put the popcorn back into the oven for five more 
     minutes, then stir once again. This will help to coat each kernel. 
     You can repeat this step once more if necessary to get all of the 
     popcorn coated. Pour popcorn onto a large sheet of wax paper to cool. 
     Spread the popcorn out, but be careful...it's hot. 

  5. When popcorn is cool, break it up and immediately put it into a 
     tightly sealed container, such as Tupperware. This will ensure that 
     it stays fresh. This stuff gets stale very quickly in moist climates 
     if left out.

     Makes about 4 quarts.

Four Seasons Crab Cakes

   break up the large lumps too much. 
   In a food processor, grind codfish until pureed. Add 1/2 cup of heavy 
   cream and puree until incorporated. Then add more cream if needed. 
   The mixture should be smooth and shiny, yet firm enough to hold its shape.

   for the olive oil. 
   Take a small portion of the crab-cake mixture and saute in hot olive 
   oil until golden brown. Taste to adjust seasoning.

   on both sides. Finish by baking in a 450-degree oven for 4 to 5 minutes.

  Hooter's Buffalo Chicken Wings


                 vegetable oil -- for frying
         1/4 cup butter
         1/4 cup Crystal Louisiana Hot Sauce
            dash ground pepper
            dash garlic powder
         1/2 cup all-purpose flour
       1/4 teas. paprika
       1/4 teas. cayenne pepper
       1/4 teas. salt
              10 chicken wing pieces

       ON THE SIDE: bleu cheese dressing & celery sticks

  Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375. You want just enough oil to cover the 
  wings entirely -- an inch or so deep at least. 

  Combine the butter, hot sauce, ground pepper, and garlic powder in a 
  small saucepan over low heat. Heat until the butter is melted and 
  the ingredients are well-blended. 

  Combine the flour, paprika, cayenne powder, and salt in a small bowl. 
  If the wings are frozen, be sure to defrost and dry them. Put the wings 
  in a large bowl and sprinkle the flour mixture over them, coating each
  wing evenly. Put the wings in the refrigerator 60-90 minutes. 
  This will help the breading to stick to the wings when fried.

  Put all the wings in the hot oil and fry 10 to 15 minutes or until 
  some parts of the wings begin to turn dark brown. Remove from the oil 
  to a paper towel to drain. Don't let them sit too long, because you 
  want to serve them hot. Quickly put the wings in a large bowl. Add the hot
  sauce and stir, coating all of the wings evenly. 

  Serve with bleu cheese dressing and celery sticks on the side.

                    1 1/2 ts Distilled white vinegar
                        1 ts Vanilla extract

                FILLING:
                        1 c  Heavy whipping cream
                        6 oz Finely chopped white chocolate
           
                GLAZE:
                        3 oz Finely chopped bittersweet chocolate          
                        3 tb Boiling water

                ICING:
                        1 tb Egg white, at room temperature
                        1 pn cream of tartar
     1/2 c  Plus 2 to 3 tbsp confectioner's sugar
           
 
 Make the cupcakes:
  
  1. Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 325F. Lightly
  butter twenty-four 1-3/4" x 3/4" (1-oz) muffin of biscuit cups.
  
  2. Into a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda,
  and salt. Mix in the sugar. Make a well in the center. Whisk in the
  water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla. Blend until smooth. (The batter
  will be very thin.)
  
  3. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups. Bake until a cake tester
  inserted into the center of one of the cupcakes comes out clean,
  about 12 to 14 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the pans on a wire rack
  for 5 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pans and finish cooling
  on the rack.
  
  Make the filling:
  
  4. In a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the cream
  to a boil. Add the white chocolate and remove from heat. let the
  mixture stand briefly; stir until smooth. Transfer to a metal bowl
  and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, stirring occasionally. (To
  speed the process, set the metal bowl over a larger bowl of ice
  water; stir the chocolate mixture until cool.) With an electric
  mixer, beat the white chocolate mixture just until fluffy, about 1
  minute.
  
  5. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch plain
  tip. Insert the pastry tip 1/4-inch into the bottom of each cupcake
  and squeeze a little filling into each one.
  
  Make the glaze:
  
  6. Place the chocolate in a small bowl. Whisk in the boiling water and
  blend until smooth. One at a time, dip the top of each cupcake into
  the warm glaze. Turn the glazed cupcakes right side up and set them
  on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet. Refrigerate the cupcakes for
  5 minutes to set the glaze.
  
  Make the icing:
  
  7. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy. Stir in the
  cream of tartar. Gradually mix in enough of the confectioner's sugar
  to make a fairly stiff and smooth icing. Fill a small paper cone with
  the icing and cut a 1/16-inch opening at the tip. Remove the cupcakes
  from the refrigerator. Pipe a design (a squiggle, spiral, etc.) on
  the top of each cupcake. Let the design harden and then cover and
  refrigerate the cupcakes. Serve at room temperature.
  
  The cupcakes can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance, or
  frozen up to 2 weeks.
  
  Makes 22 to 24 miniature cupcakes.

                 a bottle about the size of a Twinkie
                 twelve 12 x 14 inch pieces of aluminum foil
                 pastry bag 
                 toothpick

            CAKE:
              4 egg whites
              One 16-ounce box golden pound cake mix
              2/3 cup water
              Nonstick spray

            FILLING:
              2 Tbsp butter
             1/3 cup vegetable shortening
               1 cup powdered sugar
             1/4 cup granulated sugar
             1/3 cup evaporated milk
               1 tsp vanilla extract
             2 drops lemon extract

  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Fold each piece of foil in half twice. Wrap
  the folded foil around the bottle to create a mold. Leave the top open for
  pouring the batter in. Make twelve of these molds and arrange on a cookie
  sheet. Spray the inside of each with nonstick spray. 

  Beat the egg whites until stiff. Combine with cake mix and water, and beat
  about 2 minutes until thoroughly blended. Pour batter into molds, filling
  each about 3/4 inch deep. Bake about 30 minutes, or until the cake is
  golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean from the center. 

  For the filling, cream the butter and shortening. Slowly add the sugars
  while beating. Add the evaporated milk, vanilla and lemon extracts. Mix on
  medium speed until completely smooth and fluffy. When the cakes are done
  and cooled, use a toothpick to make three small holes in the bottom of
  each one. Move the toothpick around the inside of each cake to make room
  for filling. Using the pastry bag, inject each cake with filling through
  all three holes.

   Kraft Macaroni and Cheese


                       8 cups water
                       2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
                      1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese
                      1/2 cup Cheez Whiz
                2 tablespoons whole milk
                 1/4 teaspoon salt

   1. Bring 8 cups (2 quarts) of water to a boil over high heat in a 
      large saucepan. Add elbow macaroni to water and cook for 
      10 to 12 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally.

   2. As macaroni boils, prepare sauce by combining cheddar cheese, 
      Cheez Whiz, and milk in a small saucepan over medium/low heat. 
      Stir cheese mixture often as it heats, so that it does not burn. 
      Add salt. When all of the cheddar cheese has melted and the sauce is
      smooth, cover pan and set aside until macaroni is ready.

   3. When macaroni is ready, strain water, but do not rinse the macaroni.

   4. Using the same pan you prepared the macaroni in, combine the 
      macaroni with the cheese sauce, and mix well.

      Makes about 4 cups.

     2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish

     dash of black pepper

     1. Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Stir well.

  1 Can Biscuits - not flaky, buttermilk, or
      any special type. Just regular biscuits.

  Poke a hole in the center of each.

  Deep fry until brown (or fry in skillet)
  turning doughnuts once. Do not crowd.

  Drain well on paper towels.

  Because the biscuit dough has little, if
  any, sugar, you will want to either roll them
  in powdered sugar, cinnamon and
  sugar mix (1/2 powdered sugar and 1/2
  granulated sugar with cinnamon to taste),
  or glaze them (regular or chocolate).

                   1 clove garlic, chopped
               1 cup water
            2 ounces salt pork, finely chopped
              2 cups chopped onions
       3 tablespoons flour

              2 cups light cream
                     Oyster crackers (optional) 
 

   Clean the clams and place them in a large pot along with the garlic 
   and water. Steam the clams just until opened, about 6 to 10 minutes,
   depending upon their size. Drain and shell the clams, reserving
   the broth. Mince the clam flesh, and set aside. Filter the clam broth 
   either through coffee filters or cheesecloth and set aside.

   In a large, heavy pot slowly render the salt pork. Remove the cracklings 
   and set them aside. Slowly cook the onions in the fat for about 6 minutes,
   stirring frequently, or until cooked through but not browned. Stir in the 
   flour and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the reserved clam broth and 
   Fish Stock, and whisk to remove any flour lumps. Bring the liquid to a 
   boil, add the potatoes, lower the heat, and simmer until the potatoes 
   are cooked through, about 15 minutes.

   Stir in the reserved clams, salt-pork cracklings, and light cream. 
   Heat the chowder until it is the temperature you prefer. 
   Serve in large soup bowls with oyster crackers on the side.

  plastice bowl for this.

  When the sugar mixture reaches 270~F, or the soft crack stage. Remove from
  the heat and pour the mixture in thin streams into the egg whites, blending
  completely with an electric mixer set on low.

  Continue to mix about 20 minutes or until the nougat begins to harden and
  thickens to the consistency of dough. Mix in the almonds.

  Press the nougat into a greased 9 x 9 inch pan and chill until firm about
  30 minutes.

  to knock off the excess chocolate. Place on waxed paper and let cool at
  room temperature until the chocolate is firm; 1-2 hours.

   Oreo Cookies
 

 COOKIE WAFERS:

            1 (18.25 oz) box Dark Fudge Cake Mix 
          1/3 cup water
            2 tablespoons shortening

    CREME FILLING:

        3 1/2 cups powdered sugar 
          1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar 
          1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
          1/2 cup shortening (no substitution) 
            3 tablespoons hot water

 Preheat oven to 325F.  Blend all ingredients; then knead with your
 hands until it is pliable like dough.  Form dough into 3/4 inch balls
 and press flat, 1/2 inch apart on greased cookie sheets.  Bottom of
 a glass works nice for this.  Bake 4 to 6 minutes or until cookies are
 crunchy.  I should think you could refrigerate the dough in cylinder 
 shaped rolls for a couple of hours and slice 1/8 inch thick, as well.
 Let cookies cool on sheets. 

 Combine filling ingredients and mix well.  Form into balls about 1/2 to 
 3/4 inch in diameter, again using your hands.  Sandwich one
 filling in the center of two cookies and carefully press down until
 the filling spreads almost to the edge.

 Makes 2 dozen cookies (4 dozen wafers)

   Outback Steakhouse Aussie Fries


                   1 - 2 lb. bag of Frozen French Fries
                       1 Cup shredded Colby Jack cheese
                       6 pieces of Bacon, cooked
                   24 Fl. Oz. Peanut Oil (can be reused later; store
                                          in refrigerator)

   Divide the fries into half, and use the other half later. 
   Heat oil to 350 degrees. If you do not have a thermostat, make sure 
   the oil is hot enough, so that when you set a french fry in there it 
   will cook immediately. If the french fry sinks to the bottom, and 
   barely bubbles, it is not hot enough. Fry the potatoes in small
   batches, they are done when they are golden brown, and float to the 
   top of the skillet. ( I like to use a Dutch Oven). Be sure to drain 
   the potatoes on paper towels. You can keep them warm in the oven 
   while the other fries are done.

   When all french fries are done cooking, and drained place them onto 
   a platter. Salt the french fries if you like, and sprinkle on cheese 
   and cooked bacon. Pop these back into a warm oven until the cheese 
   begins to melt.

   Dipping Sauce:

   1/2 C. Sour Cream
   1 Tbsp. Prepared Horseraddish
   dash Cayenne Pepper
   dash Salt
   dash black pepper

   Combine all ingredients and mix well.

                         1/4 c honey
                     3-4 drops Tabasco sauce

   Outback Steakhouse Honey Wheat Bushman Bread


                   Dough:
                         1 1/2 cups warm water
                      2 tablespoons butter, softened
                            1/2 cup honey
                             2 cups bread flour
                         1 2/3 cups wheat flour
                       1 tablespoon cocoa
                       1 tablespoon granulated sugar
                        2 teaspoons instant coffee
                         1 teaspoon salt
           2 1/4 teaspoons (1 pkg.) yeast

               Coloring:
                            1/4 cup water
                           75 drops red food coloring
                           45 drops blue food coloring
                           30 drops yellow food coloring

                        Cornmeal for dusting

   1. If using a bread machine, add all of the ingredients for the dough 
      in the exact order listed into the pan of your machine. Set it on 
      "knead" and when the machine begins to mix the dough, combine the 
      food coloring with 1/4 cup of water and drizzle it into the mixture as
      it combines. After the dough is created let it rest to rise for an 
      hour or so. Then remove it from the pan and go to step #3.

   2. If you are not using a bread machine, combine the flours, cocoa, sugar,
      coffee and salt in large bowl. Make a depression or "well" in the 
      middle of the dry mixture. Pour the warm water into this "well," 
      then add the butter, honey and yeast. Combine the food coloring
      drops with 1/4 cup of water and add that to the "well." Slowly mix 
      the ingredients with a spoon, drawing the dry ingredients into 
      the wet. When you can handle the dough, begin to combine it by hand, 
      kneading the dough thoroughly for at least ten minutes, until it is 
      very smooth and has a consistent color. Set the dough into a covered 
      bowl in a warm place for an hour, to allow it to rise.

   3. When the dough has risen to about double in size, punch it down and 
      divide it into 8 even portions (divide dough in half, divide those 
      halves in half, and then once more). Form the portions into tubular 
      shaped loaves about 8 inches long and 2 inches wide. Sprinkle the
      entire surface of the loaves with cornmeal and place them on a cookie 
      sheet, or two. Cover the cookie sheet(s) with plastic wrap and let
      the dough rise once more for another hour in a warm location.

   4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Uncover the dough and bake it for 
      20-24 minutes in the hot oven. Loaves should begin to darken slightly 
      on top when done. Serve warm with a sharp bread knife and butter 
      on the side. If you want whipped butter, like you get at the 
      restaurant, just use an electric mixer on high speed to whip 
      some butter until it's fluffy.

      Makes 8 small loaves.


   Outback Steakhouse Sydney's Sinful Sundae


                         1 cup shredded coconut
                4 large scoops vanilla ice cream
                       1/2 cup Hershey chocolate syrup
                               whipped cream (in a can)
                      4 large, ripe strawberries

   1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
   2. Spread the coconut over the bottom of the inside of a large oven pan.
      Shake the pan a little to spread the coconut evenly.
   3. Bake the coconut for 25-30 minutes or until the coconut is a light, 
      golden brown. You may have to stir or shake the coconut in the 
      last 10 minutes to help it brown evenly.
   4. When the coconut has cooled, pour it onto a plate, or into a 
      large bowl. Roll each scoop of ice cream in the coconut until it is 
      well coated. Press down on the ice cream to help the coconut stick. 
      Put the ice cream into four separate bowls.
   5. Heat up the chocolate syrup for 10-15 seconds in the microwave. 
      Pour about two tablespoons over each scoop of ice cream. 
      Try to completely cover the ice cream with chocolate.
   6. Spray some whipped cream on the top of each scoop of ice cream.
   7. Cut the stems from the strawberries and place one on each serving; 
      upside down on the whipped cream. Serve with a spoon.

      Serves four.

   Pillsbury Crescent Rolls
 

                      2 pk Active Dry Yeast
                    3/4 c  Warm Water (105 degrees)

   Snickers Candy Bar


                    1/4  cup light corn syrup
               2 tablespoons butter
                1 tablespoon vanilla extract
                     1/8 cup peanut butter
                      1 dash salt
                      3 cups powdered sugar
                          35 unwrapped Kraft caramels
                       1 cup dry-roasted unsalted peanuts
                       1 bag milk-chocolate chips -- (12-ounce)

   With the mixer on high speed, combine the corn syrup, butter, vanilla,
   peanut butter, and salt until creamy.  Slowly add the powdered sugar.
   When the mixture has the consistency of dough, remove it from the bowl
   with your hands and press it into a lightly greased 9x9-inch pan. Put in
   the refrigerator. Melt the caramels in a small pan over low heat.
   When the caramel is soft, mix in the peanuts.  Pour the mixture over the
   refrigerated nougat in the pan. Let this cool in the refrigerator.
   When the refrigerated mixture is firm, melt the chocolate over low heat
   in a double boiler or in a microwave oven set on high for 2 minutes.
   Stir halfway through cooking time. When the mixture in the pan has
   hardened, cut it into 2x1-inch sections. Set each chunk onto a fork
   and dip into the melted chocolate. Tap the fork against the side of the
   bowl or pan to knock off any excess chocolate. Then place the chunks on
   waxed paper to cool at room temperature (less than 70 degrees F). This
   could take several hours, but the bars will set best this way. You can
   speed up the process by placing the bars in the refrigerator for 30 
   minutes.

   Makes about 2 dozen bars.

                   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

     garlic will sit flat. Remove the papery skin from the garlic, but 
     leave enough so that the cloves stay together. Put garlic into a 
     small casserole dish or baking pan, drizzle olive oil over it, and 
     cover with a lid or foil. Bake in a preheated 325° oven for 1 hour. 
     Remove garlic and let it cool until you can handle it.

     brown sugar in a medium saucepan over medium/high heat. 
     Stir occasionally until mixture boils then reduce heat until mixture 
     is just simmering.

  3. Squeeze the sides of the head of garlic until the pasty roasted garlic 
     is squeezed out. Discard remaining skin and whisk to combine.

  4. Add remaining ingredients to the pan and stir.

  5. Let mixture simmer for 40-50 minutes or until sauce has reduced by 
     about 1/2 and is thick and syrupy. Make sure it doesn't boil over.

                         3 T granulated sugar
                           1 egg
                        2 t. vanilla extract
                      1/2 t. baking soda
                      1/2 t. baking powder
                      1/2 t. salt
                   1-3/4 cup flour
                    1-1/2 t. instant espresso powder, slightly crushed
                    8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips

Thomas English Muffins


 1 lb All-purpose or bread flour
 1 t Salt
 1 1/2 T Dry yeast
 1 t Sugar
 1 cup Warm milk 
 2 oz Butter, melted

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and leave in a warm place. Dissolve
the yeast and sugar in warm (105 F) milk (M-Waved). Let froth,
then mix in the butter. Stir all the liquid into the warm flour and beat
well until smooth and elastic. Cover and proof in a warm place for 50
minutes or until doubled in bulk. Turn onto a well-floured board and
knead, working a little more flour if necessary to make the dough easier
to shape. Round up the dough, roll into a thick sausage shape and (using
the sharpest knife you have) slice into 8 to 10 portions, each about 1 1/2
~ 1 3/4 inch thick. Shape each one into a round with straight sides. Put
onto a greased baking sheet. Cover (use greased plastic wrap) and put
in a warm place to proof for 30-40 minutes or until springy to the touch.
Leave room for expansion and be careful not to over-proof, as the muffins
will get flabby and lose their shape. Warm and grease the bakestone
lightly. Lift the muffins carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very
moderate heat for 8-10 minutes until pale gold underneath. Turn and cook
the other side. Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches. To
serve, insert a knife in the side, pull the top and bottom slightly apart,
and insert slivers of butter.

   Twix Bars


    35 unwrapped Kraft caramels
    1/4 cup water
    1 box Nabisco Lorna Doone shortbread
          cookies -- (40)
    2 bags milk-chocolate chips -- (12 ounce)

   1. Combine the caramels with the water in a small pan and melt over 
      low heat.
   2. Place the shortbread cookies side by side on an ungreased cookie sheet.
   3. Spoon a dab of caramel onto each cookie. Then place all the cookies in
      the refrigerator until the caramel firms up.
   4. In the meantime, in a double boiler over low heat, melt the chocolate
      chips. You may also use the microwave for melting the chocolate.
      Just heat the chips for 1 minute on high, stir, then heat for
      another minute.
   5. Remove the cookies from the refrigerator. Rest each one on a fork and 
      dip it into the chocolate. Tap the fork on the side of the pan or bowl
      to knock off any excess chocoloate. Then place each one on a sheet
      of waxed paper and let them cool at room temperature (65-70F).
      This could take several hours, but the bars will set best this way.
      If you want to speed up the process, put the candy in the
      refrigerator for 30 minutes.

      Makes 40 bars.

      Melt thoroughly, but do not overheat. Melting
      the chocolate chips can also be done using a
      double-boiler over low heat. 
  7. Drop each patty into the chocolate and coat completely.
      Using 2 forks, one in each hand, lift the coated patty from the  
      chocolate. Gently tap the forks against the bowl to knock of  
      the excess chocolate and place each patty on waxed paper.
  8. Chill the peppermint patties until firm, about 
      30 minutes. Makes 20 peppermint patties.
