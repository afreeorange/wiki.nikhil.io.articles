Ingredients
-----------

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/3 cup water
* 1 tbsp instant yeast
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp salt

Preparation
-----------

### Dough

Mixed all ingredients in a bowl with a spoon. Coated cast-iron skillet with
bacon grease. Poured the mixture into skillet. Wet fingers and spread the
dough to cover the skillet (mostly) evenly. Covered in shrink wrap and waited
until dough was sufficiently risen (eyeballed it).

### Bake

* Heated oven to 500F
* Put in skillet with dough
* Turn on broiler for 2 min
* Turn off broiler, take skillet out, add toppings
* Return to oven on bottom rack
* Bake for 10-12 minutes
    * (Turn on stove after 7mins)

### Crunchy bottom

* Turn on electric stove at highest setting (700F center, 500F outer)
* Place skillet on stove for 3-4 minutes

Results
-------

Need the bottom to be better, more evenly heated. Imagine that cast-iron
pizza can be made entirely on the stove. Need to research recipes.
