Bruunusto
---------

Simple taste, medium-hard texture. Can use for grilling, [as pizza
topping](Pizza_Experiment_I "wikilink"), or eat it by itself with eggs
in the morning.

Seller said it was made with parmesan cultures. Soft yet brittle.
Mellow, drier taste. Can maybe shred over a plate of pasta :)
