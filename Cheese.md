### Mitica Alisios

Rubbed with paprika. Simply _excellent_ when steamed on sunny-side up eggs.

### [Mt. Tam Triple Creme with Bloomy Rind](https://cowgirlcreamery.com/pages/mt-tam)

As good as a triple creme can get. The rind is a bit bitter. Not very nice when refrigerated; keep it at room temperature. Fantastic by itself.
