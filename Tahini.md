Ingredients
-----------

-   2 cups sesame seeds
-   Â½ cup olive oil (normal, *not* extra-virgin)

Preparation
-----------

-   Toast seeds on a pan at medium heat.

:   Don't toast them *too* much; look for a nice, light-brown color.

-   Set aside, let them cool down to room temperature.
-   Mix seeds with olive oil. If you don't, you'll send seeds flying
    everywhere when you...
-   Blend away!
-   Add olive oil by the teaspoon to get the paste to a thick yet
    pourable consistency.
