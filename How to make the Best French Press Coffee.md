Start with a French Press. You don't need to pre-warm the glass by filling it with boiling hot water. Don't be that person.

You'll need fresh, _whole_ coffee beans. You want to grind them somewhere close to coarse. I have [one of these](https://baratza.com/grinder/encore/) and set it to "30".

Depends on the bean but I start with a 1:8 ratio and adjust later.

Place ground beans in the carafe. Pour boiling hot water over the beans. Place the plunger just over the mouth of the carafe and let it **sit for 3 minutes**.

Then take a spoon and disturb the foamy layer. Gently push the grounds down (not all the way; just a few inches.) Replace plunger at the mouth of the carafe. You'll wait for them to **settle down to the bottom for 5 minutes**.

Push plunger down to no resistance whatsoever. Enjoy the lovely stuff ‚òïÔ∏èü•∞
