# Window Of Tolerance (Polyvagal Theory)

## State Of Hyperarousal

* **Sympathetic System Activated**: Acceleration of autonomic nervous system response (increased heart rate, blood pressure, blood flow to large muscles, etc. ) – heightened sensations
* **“Flight/Fight” Response Activated**: State of hyper-vigilance, anxiety, perception of challenge or danger
* **Disorganized Cognitive Processing**: thinking is rigid or chaotic, poor judgment, racing thoughts, obsessive thoughts & behaviors, intrusive emotions/images, emotional reactivity, dread
* **No New Learning Can Take Place**

## Optimal Zone Of Arousal-window Of Tolerance

* **Parasympathetic System Stimulated (Ventral Vagal Nerve)**: Deceleration of automatic nervous system response, body regulated. State where emotions tolerated and information integrated – NORMALIZED SENSATIONS
* **Full Activation of Pre-Frontal Cortex**: greater access to intuition and insight, calm, alert, relaxed, aware, coherent
* **Social Engagement System Activated**: Self-soothing/emotion regulation system activated, fear modulated
* **Experience Full Range of Emotions**: (joy, grief, anger, etc.) with a sense of control and awareness of options.
* **New Learning Can Take Place**

## State Of Hypoarousal

* **Parasympathetic System Activated (Dorsal Vagal Nerve)**: Extreme deceleration of autonomic nervous system response (decreased heart rate, blood flow to extremities, etc.) – ABSENCE OF SENSATIONS
* **“Freeze” Response Activated**: slowed or disabled thinking process, dissocation of awareness, isolation/withdrawal, depression, numb, hopelessness, shut-down response, disabled defensive responses
* **No New Learning Can Take Place**
