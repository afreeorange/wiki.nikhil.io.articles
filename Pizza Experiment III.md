Ingredients
-----------

-   2½ cups King Arthur bread flour
-   1 cup distilled water
-   1 tbsp instant yeast
-   2 tsp salt
-   1½ tbsp olive oil
-   1 tbsp sugar

Implements
----------

-   Cast-iron skillet
-   Plastic wrap

Dough Prep
----------

Mix ingredients, knead until dough is as smooth as a baby's... the tip
of your nose. Place in well-oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap,
let rise for 1 hour.

Cut in half, roll dough into circular shape, place in skillet. Cover
with wet cloth, let rise for another hour.

Pizza Prep
----------

Turn heat on stove to high (I have an electric stove), heat skillet
(with dough) for 3 minutes. Then place in oven at 450F, cook for 18
minutes or until crust is golden brown.

Oh noes!
--------

3 minutes on an electric stove was *too much*! Burned the bottom of
pizza. Good crust though! Crispy out, soft in.
