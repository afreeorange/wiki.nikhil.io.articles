-   1 tbsp olive oil
-   1 tsp salt

Pizza Prep
----------

Set oven to 450F.

Set electric stove to med-high. Place skillet on it for 60-70s.

Place in oven with *no* toppings for 5 minutes. You'll get an
undercooked crust below all them toppings.

Remove, add toppings, and cook for 20 minutes or until golden brown.

Let rest for 5 minutes.

Consume, son.

Results
-------

Not bad. Crust not too open. Crunchy out, soft and chewy in. Will try
this again, except will

-   Fold dough over the next time.
-   Heat skillet on high *without* dough. Can pour when temp's reached.
