Crust was *bland*. To do the next time:

-   Use a little more salt
-   Bake directly on stone @ 450F
-   Use honey?

### Trial II

Same as I, except:

-   ⅓ cup water
-   525F for \~10 mins

[Made a movie about it
too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t-FMg9ZFFc). Dough wasn't soft and
enough after kneading. Not enough water ∴ not a good rise. Still pretty
decent. Used sauted onions, red peppers, and green beans, with a little
rosemary, and pepper. Awesome with Sriracha.

### Trial III

Same as II, except with ½ cup water and a few flour dustings. Very thin
crust. Awesome. [Another video for this is
fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qegk-MrQMMg).
