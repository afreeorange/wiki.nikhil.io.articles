\_\_NOTOC\_\_

Same recipe and (almost) same prep as [Pizza Experiment
III](Pizza_Experiment_III "wikilink"). Except this time, I

-   Tried not to burn the dough
-   Refrigerated dough overnight
-   Let dough get to room temp for nearly 2 hours.

Dough Prep
----------

Roll out dough into skillet. Make it look nice. Cover and leave it alone
for 1 hour. Half an hour into rest, turn on oven to 450F.

Pizza Prep
----------

Set electric stove to med-high. Place skillet on it for 50-60s. Center
of skillet shoots up to \~340F. I checked.

Place in oven and cook for 18 minutes or until golden brown. Let's hope
for better luck this time.
