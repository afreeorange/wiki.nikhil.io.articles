Same recipe and (almost) same prep as [Pizza Experiment III](Pizza Experiment III). 
Except this time, I

* Tried not to burn the dough
* Refrigerated dough overnight
* Let dough get to room temp for nearly 2 hours.

Prep
----

Roll out dough into skillet. Make it look nice. Cover and leave it alone
for 1 hour. Half an hour into rest, turn on oven to 450F.

Set electric stove to med-high. Place skillet on it for 50-60s. Center
of skillet shoots up to \~340F. I checked.

Place in oven with toppings and cook for 18 minutes or until golden
brown.

Bloody hell, mate
-----------------

I couldn't get the dough circular, so folded it over again to get a
ball. Big mistake. Dough got too glutinous and wouldn't stretch out.
Still decent crust, but not as open as I'd have liked it to be.
