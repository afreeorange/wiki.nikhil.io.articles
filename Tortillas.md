Via BL. This makes 12-16 easily. They're amazing chapatis/rotis as well.

### Ingredients

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup water - _hot_
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/3 cup oil

### Preparation

Mix and knead everything except water first until it's all crumbly. Then add the water and knead until smooth. Rest for about 20-30 minutes. Make dough balls, rest for another 30-40 minutes. Flatten on a floured surface, and cook them a minute per side. _Bubbles are good_!

### Notes

If you used lard instead of oil and deep-fried them, you'd get what they serve at the legendary [Tasty Tacos](https://www.tastytacos.com/) in Des Moines.
