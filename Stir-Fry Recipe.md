#### Sweet-and-Sour Sauce

#### Spicy Sauce

### Step 5: Stir-Fry

Drain excess marinade from protein. Place sauce, veggies, and protein near the stove.

Heat 1/4 inch peanut or vegetable oil in a wok or skillet over medium heat. Add the protein; slowly stir until almost opaque, 30 seconds to 1 minute (for tofu, brown on both sides â€“ do not stir). Transfer to plate; discard the oil and wipe out the pan.

Heat the pan over high heat, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons oil, then 2 cloves minced garlic (or 4 cloves for Spicy Sauce), 1 to 2 tablespoons minced ginger, 2 minced scallions, and a pinch each of salt and sugar; stir-fry about 30 seconds. Add the veggies, starting with the ones that take the longest to cook; stir-fry until crisp-tender.

Add the protein and sauce and stir until the sauce is thick and the vegetables and protein are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Thin with chicken broth, if needed. Garnish with sliced scallions, peanuts, sesame seeds, sliced jalapenos, and/or cilantro.
