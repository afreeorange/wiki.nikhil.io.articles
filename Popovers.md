You'll need [a popover
pan](http://www.amazon.com/Chicago-Metallic-Stick-6-Cup-Popover/dp/B003YL3DWO)
for this.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 large eggs (\~½ cup)
-   ⅔ cup milk (I used whole milk)
-   ⅔ cup flour
-   pinch of salt
-   some butter

Preparation
-----------

### Batter

-   Heat milk in microwave. Should be lukewarm.
-   Whisk in eggs.
-   Use ⅓-cup scoops to mix in flour
-   Add salt
-   Whisk away until you get a nice, creamy consistency
-   *No lumps*. The batter should be able to escape a cloth sieve.

### Baking

-   Preheat oven to 425F.
-   Scoop 2 tbsp butter into each popover cup.
-   Once oven's hot, heat pan for 5 minutes. Butter should have browned
    at least a little.
-   Remove, fill each cup a third up with batter.
-   Return to oven, bake for 20 minutes
-   **No peeking!** Seriously.
-   After 20 minutes, reduce temperature to 350F
-   Bake for another 15-17 minutes

Stuff face with resulting awesomeness immediately. Call your friends.
They taste like shit when microwaved.
