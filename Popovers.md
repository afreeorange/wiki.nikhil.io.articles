You'll need [a popover
pan](http://www.amazon.com/Chicago-Metallic-Stick-6-Cup-Popover/dp/B003YL3DWO)
for this. Stop being cheap.

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 large eggs
    [(\~½ cup)](http://whatscookingamerica.net/Eggs/EggEquivalent.htm)
    at *room temperature*
-   1 cup milk at *room temperature* (I used whole milk)
-   1 cup flour
-   1 tsp salt
-   1 tbsp butter at *room temperature*

Preparation
-----------

### Batter

-   Whisk milk and eggs together.
-   Use ⅓-cup scoops to mix in flour gradually.
-   Add salt and butter.
-   Whisk away until you get a nice, creamy consistency
-   *No lumps*. Use a blender if necessary. The batter should be able to
    escape a cloth sieve.

### Baking

-   Preheat oven to 425F.
-   Scoop 1 tbsp butter into each popover cup.
-   Once oven's hot, heat pan for 5 minutes. Butter should have browned
    at least a little.
-   Remove, fill each cup a third up with batter.
-   Return to oven, bake for 20 minutes
-   **No peeking!** Seriously.
-   After 20 minutes, reduce temperature to 350F
-   Bake for another 15-17 minutes

Stuff face with resulting awesomeness immediately. Have friends
available. They taste like shit when microwaved/heated later (even when
stored in ziploc.)
