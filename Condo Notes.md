- _Lennox Package Rooftop Unit_ on Northmost End of roof.
- Serial `5608G11033`, manufactured 2008 (that's what the "08" in the number means)
- Model `TGA036S2-PKG` (the "03" means it's a 3-ton unit)

Any maintenance personnel will need roof access. The disconnect box is marked on the outside with the unit number.

A capacitor was busted and needed replacemen (they typically last about 10-15 years). The compressor was very hot and needed to cool down. Worked with [Lozier Heating and Cooling](https://www.lozierheatingcooling.com/) for a satisfactory resolution. Highly recommended. The replacement will outlive the unit and Lozier provides a guarantee.
